Not only because of the fact that it’s taking a lot of lives but it’s also destroying the world’s economy. First, almost all the major countries closed their borders to make sure that the virus doesn’t spread. But they are opening their borders one by one because their economy is not running. In order to keep the flow of the economy running the borders are opening gradually. So, the airlines are also resuming their operations for the convenience of the people.

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re a PIA - <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/pakistan-international-airlines-flights"><strong>Pakistan International Airlines</strong></a> traveller, then there is good news for you as the airline is about to start a new domestic destination.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">PIA (Pakistan International Airline) is the flagship carrier of Pakistan, and it offers many domestic and international destinations. But there were many domestic places where people wanted this airline to reach, but it wasn’t possible because of the different and challenging scenarios. One of such destinations is undoubtedly Swat. First, because of the terrorist activity, the airport needed to be closed. Still, once the social situation got under control, the global pandemic started that even stopped the existing and operating routes. After the vaccination and reopening of the Swat airport, the government of Pakistan has started operating flights from Islamabad to Swat. We have come up today with a piece of similar news about Skardu.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flights to Skardu</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you don’t already know, PIA (Pakistan International Airlines) has already planned Lahore to Skardu flights that all will fly directly from the capital of Punjab to Skardu. But the excellent news for the residents of Karachi is that the PIA is starting air ticket reservations from Karachi to Skardu. Moreover, the safari flight from Islamabad to Skardu will also be started. The airline has planned to operate these flights for the first time on the second day of this Eid ul Fitr.</p>

<p>
<strong>Must Read:</strong> <a style="color:Purple;" href="https://blog.faremakers.com/Blog/2021/3/29/pia-final-verdict-on-flights-to-swat"><strong>PIA Flight To Swat</strong></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The PIA (Pakistan International Airlines) spokesperson said that the Airbus A320 would be used for the flights from Karachi to Skardu and then back from Skardu to Karachi. He added that this flight is being started to help the residents of Sindh''s capital and the residents of Skardu. It will improve the tourism of the country and improve the business and economy as well.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Weather Condition</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The spokesperson also said that the dates are announced, we will have to see the weather conditions for the flights if they are not in favour of the journey then the flight will be diverted to land in the capital of the country Islamabad. Moreover, the official also mentioned that the people getting their <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>air ticket reservation</strong></a> for Karachi to Skardu flights must know that the duration of this flight will be two hours and fifteen minutes. He continued that the new plans are also in the airline''s queue as the flights from Lahore to Chitral and Lahore to Gilgit will also be started in the next phase. The same will be the case for the flights from Karachi to Gilgit and Karachi to Chitral.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final Thoughts</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to bear in mind that it will be the first time that the flights from Karachi to the far northern areas of Pakistan will be operated by any airline. Before, these flights were only used to be operated from Islamabad. The aim to increase the number of flights from different areas of Pakistan to Northern areas is to promote healthy tourism in the country. Not only will it improve the local but it will also help improve the international tourism slowly and gradually.</p>', N'pia-plans-to-start-direct-flights-from-karachi-to-skardu', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 612, 1, CAST(N'2021-04-21T15:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Pakistan International Airlines remains under the travel restriction that European Union had imposed a while ago. Here''s what you need to know.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Let''s face it; we are living in the darkest of the times of the current century. More than tens of thousands of people have lost their lives, but the world''s economy is still significantly affected. Moreover, the old tourism and air travel environment that once used to be is still sitting on the fence. All the countries around the globe are going the extra mile to make sure that covid-19 doesn''t spread anymore, but at some places, the results are not as desired. Unfortunately, our country is experiencing the same currently. That''s why European Union Aviation has yet again extended the travel restrictions on <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/pakistan-international-airlines-flights"><strong>Pakistan International Airlines</strong></a>.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Details of the Current Matter</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency) has decided that the imposed restriction on PIA will be extended. Moreover, the Agency has also not declared any solid-state period and has directed the PCAA (Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority) that the country needs its safety audit done by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). It''s scheduled for near July, and after its success, you''ll book your cheap air tickets to Europe.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Earlier Restriction</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It''s essential to keep in mind that the European Union restricted Pakistan for the first time because of covid-19 in July 2020. The Agency has decided to carry on this restriction, and it was decided on 31st March 2021. At that time, it was announced that the restriction is imposed for an additional three months. But the latest intimation that the Agency sent to Pakistan signifies that it''s still not defined that for how long this restriction will continue. The EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency) has also mentioned that when the restriction is lifted from Pakistan International Airlines, it will be notified again.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The reasoning of the Restriction Extension</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The reasoning that the EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency) provided is that all the crew members and engineers that it holds don''t hold Pakistan''s license. It means that they won''t fully mitigate all the possible concerns about the authority''s oversight capabilities.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A letter from EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency) stated that the restriction would remain the same until the next ICAO audit and its results. Moreover, after that, it will be decided what will be the way forward and whether people will grab their <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>cheap air tickets</strong></a> to Europe freely or not.</p>', N'european-union-aviation-extends-travel-restrictions-on-pia', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 271, 1, CAST(N'2021-04-09T12:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the biggest challenges related to almost all types of air traveling is choosing the best travel agent. Here is how you can do it most effectively.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Choosing the <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>best travel agents</strong></a> to manage your travelling plan is one of the most daunting tasks because of the abundance of agencies available. Not only does it cost you a lot of time, but you also need a lot of effort to find the best travel agents that suit your needs the best. Consulting with a travel agent is always helpful because it allows you to find the best rates to opt for an Air Blue flight booking or any other airline.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, it also makes it easy for you to find out the best tourist attractions that you should visit in any particular area. That’s why we have compiled this guide that contains the best tips to choose the most suitable travel agent for your travel plans.</p>

<p>
<strong>Must Read:</strong> <a style="color:Purple;" href="https://blog.faremakers.com/Blog/2021/7/8/how-to-spend-a-family-summer-vacation-in-london"><strong>Family Summer Vacation In London</strong></a>
</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Perform Research</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The first and essential step to finding the best travel agency is to perform research. You have to keep in mind that it can easily take a lot of time. It becomes even more critical when your family members or friends are counting on you. You must take several steps, like locating the agent, booking Air Blue flights or finding other modes of transport, reserving your hotel and holiday apartments, obtaining other essential travel documents, and much more.
Even after finding the perfect travel agency, all processes take a lot of time. So, it''s always worth planning. Keep your holiday plans for a month or two if you require a travel agency.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Try to Find References</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It would be best to ask for customer references throughout your reservation with the traveler, whom you feel is the appropriate choice. It will allow you to find the best Airblue Flights Booking fares or fares of any other airline. The reason is that when you reserve a vacation with a tour operator who doesn''t know the location you are visiting before, you may make this journey an unpleasant experience for you.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Tour operators must have the appropriate know-how, contacts, resources, local experience, topographic knowledge and transit in the city, and much more. When you obtain your customers'' feedback, you will learn more about the travel agency.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Count Only on Professionals</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You have to reserve a travel agent with knowledge and experience in becoming a trip guide while traveling with a group of people or traveling alone. For a long time, professionals who have been in the company are aware of the many undesirable circumstances during their holidays. In addition, you are looking for various kinds of holidays or weekend holidays. But then you need to book with a cruise agency with experience in the field of cruise boats if you intend to spend your hours on an island or a cruise ship. So, don''t just pay a bit less by a travel agency with less travel knowledge to book your flights.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stick to Your Budget</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It would assist if you kept on with your budget, irrespective of the travel agency''s methods. Several travel agencies say that they spend more on the transaction. Some of the firms employ numerous tricks to have you select a high-cost destination.
Therefore, you constantly adhere to the pre-planned budget. Due to the lack of the exact fee schemes for travel agencies, inquire in advance whether their fee may be paid at the cost of your journey with <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/airblue-flights"><strong>Airblue online flights</strong></a> or any other.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be Open-minded</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Before you give you any recommendations on an itinerary, a professional travel adviser will question you about your hobbies and physical skills. You might propose activities or sites that you didn''t think of. If you find the best travel agency such as Faremakers, listen to their advice because they are professionals.
According to the general rule of thumb, the better the experience, the more alternatives you have. Having a better grasp of the world and appreciating its variety is the fundamental motivation for our trip with Airblue flight ticket booking or any other airline. Stay open to surprises, and don''t worry about going outside your comfort area. The unexpected ones are frequently the most unforgettable and most gratifying experiences.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stay Local</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no possible alternative to personal contact. One to one will be your most satisfactory experience with any travel advisor. It is something that internet agencies can''t equal to meet. Seeing the agent in the eye and shaking their hand is only possible if you stay local.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">But even then, dealing with an extensive and trustable agency will undoubtedly have a trustful voice over the phone compared to the frequently incomprehensible script-reading customer service agent.</p>', N'best-travel-agent-in-2021-for-enjoying-summer-with-family', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 583, 1, CAST(N'2021-08-03T10:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">As a Pakistani its really great news, Pakistan is always a favorite destination of all vloggers due to its domestic airlines services such as <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/airblue-flights   "><strong>Air Blue Online Flight Booking</strong></a>. Pakistan’s first online travel company going to tell you, why vloggers prefer to explore the Pakistan? The basic reason is love, a friendly environment, majestic landscapes, natural beauty and a lot of respect.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Vloggers and the real explorer of the Pakistan viral lots of videos and confess it that Pakistan is one of the most favorite and ever top listed destinations, as we know Drews binky, Jordan Taylor and a lot of other vloggers visited in Pakistan and everyone appreciates the nation’s hospitality. But the most recently Eva Zu Beck visited Pakistan and shares her positive views about the Pakistan on the social media. Let’s look over her views.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eva Zu Beck’s reviews</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We know Eva Zu Beck recently visited Pakistan and we should know about the previous history of this vlogger. She has visited 60 countries. She says, Pakistan is the word the best destination for travel and she says, Traveling in Pakistan is a truly unique experience, it can be frustrating, enlightening, life-changing and, more often than not, surprisingly. Pakistan is a definitive hiking goal and in the event that you are a fanatic of genuine experience, it''s the ideal opportunity for you to head out to Pakistan! She really used her time in knowing what Pakistani culture and its people are truly like. From creating videos and telling stories about her experiences in Pakistan, she showed the true picture of the country.</p>
<p>
<strong>Must Read:</strong> <a style="color:Purple;" href="https://blog.faremakers.com/Blog/2019/4/15/why-drew-binsky-says-i-love-pakistan   "><strong>Why Drew Binsky Says “I love Pakistan”</strong></a>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Pakistani individuals are no ifs, and or buts, the most friendly, kind and inviting people that she has ever experienced. From the clamoring lanes of Lahore to the interesting mountain towns of Hunza, each time a neighborhood individual spotted me, I would, no matter what, be compensated with a colossal smile and frequently a solicitation to supper.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">She says before traveling, she has a lot of questions in the mind, like, is it safe to travel to Pakistan? She says after a visit to Pakistan the answer is relatively simple. Indeed, as long as you avoid the Afghanistan fringe districts. The facts demonstrate that Pakistan does now and then get hit by psychological militant assaults (there were two while I was there) yet, at the present time, each nation on the planet is by all accounts a reasonable game and you are no more secure sitting at home. The media feeds on fear and prejudice, do not let you be influenced.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Schedule Trip For Vlogger’s Favorite Destination</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end, we just say Pakistan is really most safe and most favorite destination. So, without wasting time, you should enjoy your Pakistani tour through the Air Blue Online Flight Booking. <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/   "><strong>Faremakers</strong></a> always welcome you with bundles of travel deals and love.

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fly Dubai Services</span>!</h3>

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">It now seems that the things are getting normal with each passing day. Though the pandemic is still wreaking havoc on the European countries, the situation in Asian and Arabian countries is relatively better. The death rate in these countries is quite low, and the level of disruption is also not catastrophic. So, the governments in these countries have started easing the lockdown restrictions so that people could resume their day-to-day activities.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Pakistan, government has lifted the bans and imposed a partial lockdown. As per the recent announcements, people can do their business from Monday to Thursday. They are allowed to open their shops from 9:00 Am to 5:00 PM. But, no business is allowed on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, because doing so might increase the number of cases in Pakistan. So, keeping the decision of partial lockdown in mind, government has allowed PIA and Serene Air to resume their domestic flight operations.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Resumption Schedule</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan has announced that the domestic flights of two airlines would be resumed from May 16.

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is worth noting that the government of Pakistan extended the suspension of domestic and international flights in April. The decision was taken in line with the national plan to counter the spread of COVID-19. However, Pakistan resumed some special flights during that period to repatriate the stuck Pakistani nationals. The government officials are expecting that all the domestic and international flights will be resumed once the effects of pandemic subside.</p>', N'domestic-flight-operations-will-be-resumed-from-16th-of-may', N'Hamza Farooq', NULL, 998, 1, CAST(N'2020-05-15T13:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Kuala Lumpur is the capital and the largest city of Malaysia. The city depicts a stunning blend of royal Islamic architecture and cosmopolitan beauty. Due to the presence of sparkling towers and shiny beaches, Kuala Lumpur is also referred to as the “City of Lights”. Plus, you will also find vibrant festivities and events given that people of many communities live here.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The central focus of this bustling city is tourism. Each year, millions of people flock to Kuala Lumpur through <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>Cheap Flight Tickets</strong></a> to observe the beauty of not only the mosques and temples but also the towering skyscrapers and the crowded shopping malls. Even though there are hundreds of places to visit in this magical city, some sites are considered the essence of Kuala Lumpur. These significant sites are not only cheaper to visit, but they also have a unique charisma which is hard to find anywhere else in the city. In today’s piece, we have unveiled all the places in Kuala Lumpur where you will be able to create striking memories. Let’s get started.</p>

<h3>1.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">PETRONAS Twin Towers</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are suffering from acrophobia (fear of heights), then you need to think twice before visiting the PETRONAS Twin Towers. However, if you have an adventurous nature, then you can challenge yourself and look out over the city from hundreds of feet in the air. At the height of 170 meters, the world’s highest double-check bridge connects the two towers together. The tower one is occupied by the Malaysian state oil company, while the second tower is taken up by international companies, including Al-Jazeera, Microsoft, Boeing, and more.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Surprisingly, the towers are even higher than the bridge, soaring 40 meters into the sky. It took the laborers seven years to build these landmark towers.</p>

<h3>2.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Batu Caves</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Batu Caves is a limestone hill comprising bigger and smaller caves. The hill is located about 11 km north of the Kuala Lumpur and features the 100-year-old statues and idols erected inside the main caves. Amazingly, the caves are guarded by a colossal statue of the Hindu deity Murugan. There is also a Hindu temple here, which is said to be around 400 million years old.</p>

<h3>3.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">KLCC Park</span>:</h3>

The fountain becomes immensely impressive at night when you can witness its changing colors against the backdrop of the luminous PETRONAS Towers.

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">A new system from UK that will categorize the countries according to their COVID-19 restrictions means it''ll tell the availability of Lahore to London flights.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To make international travel and understand the whole scenarios more easily and effectively, the UK has announced a new Traffic Light system. It will allow the government to categorize all the counties according to their current requirements for the COVID-19 travel. This system came out on Friday (9th April 2021). It will also help the country lift the restrictions that are currently in effect from the countries where it’s safe to travel. We can hope good things from this step that it will help the country understand Pakistan''s current situation and allow <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/pakistan-international-airlines-flights"><strong>Pakistan International Airlines</strong></a> to travel to the UK as soon as possible.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Details of the Traffic Light System</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s a system that will automatically slot different countries under the green, amber, and red system. It will help the United Kingdom government determine that passengers from which countries are required to have a home or hotel quarantine along with the stringent COVID-19 testing system also in place. However, all the countries'' full categorisation under this traffic light system is yet to be launched. It is expected that that will be released for the next stage of the current lockdown, which will take place on 17th May 2021.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">International Travel: The Economy Booster</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Like any other country, international travel for the United Kingdom also boosts the country''s economy. It brings people together from different areas of the world, but it also helps businesses flourish. The framework that the United Kingdom government has announced recently will undoubtedly help the country reopen its international air borders for different countries very soon. It’s just a matter of time when you will be able to book Lahore to London flights.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, humanity has achieved one of the greatest milestones of the current time in the COVID-19 vaccine. Now the other factors to bring peace of mind such as opening the normal international travel, people''s safety without worrying, etc are remaining.</p>

</p>


<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Categorisation of the New System</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The countries that will fall under the green arrival will be considered safest. That will only need to take a test before departing, along with a PCR test before arrival back into the UK. They won’t need to spend any quarantine time on their return.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The countries under the Amber category will be considered medium risk, and they will need to quarantine for ten days and will also need to take a test before departing along with PCR.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, the countries under the red category will be considered highly risky, and people from these countries will be subjected to all the possible restrictions. There are 40 countries on this list, and they’ll need to spend ten days in established places for quarantine, and people will also need to go for OCR and pre-departure tests. There are also some counties from where people are not allowed to travel to the UK. That’s why you can’t take <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/flights/cheap-flights-from-lahore-to-london"><strong>Lahore to London flights</strong></a> for now as our country is under the restricted country list.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">But the travel will be open soon, and it will be possible to travel to the UK as soon as the COIVD-19 spread stops and the situation gets under control.</p>', N'uk-release-traffic-light-system-for-international-travel', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 296, 1, CAST(N'2021-04-13T09:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">To improve tourism and bring back the old joy of leisure travel, <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/pakistan-international-airlines-flights"><strong>Pakistan International Airlines</strong></a> has planned to start Air Safari service this month.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Last Tuesday, PIA announced that it will now start its Air Safari service. According to the latest reports, the service will start on the 12th of this month, and it’ll help improve the suspended tourism. If you want to enjoy this service, consider reading this piece of information until the very end. We hope that it will help you plan a fantastic trip with your family as soon as the flights start.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Details of the Safari Service</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to a PIA spokeswoman, the inaugural flight from Islamabad to Skardu would take place on June 12, with a one-way fare of Rs25,000. After the legendary mountaineer Ali Sadpara, who died together with two international mountaineers during their bid to scale K2 in the winter, PIA has called this service ‘Sadpara Air Safari.</p>

</strong></a>
</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Places that the Service will Roam</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Safari trip will depart from the New Islamabad Airport every Saturday and fly over the high K2, Nanga Parbat, Gasherbrum peaks, Deosai plains, and the famous Saif ul Maluk lake, according to the national carrier. If you’re from Karachi, then consider booking the best available <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/flights/cheap-flights-from-karachi-to-lahore"><strong>Karachi to Lahore flight deals</strong></a> and then Islamabad, or you can also grab direct Karachi to Islamabad flights to enjoy this service this summer.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Pakistan''s tallest mountains, K2 and Nanga Parbat, are famous among mountaineers. At 8,611 meters above sea level, K2 is the world''s second-highest mountain. The national flag carrier announced the beginning of the Air Safari service in 2018.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">However, due to operational issues, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has cancelled its scheduled commercial launch of the Safari flight just days after introducing the service. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) gave a TPRI (Tourism Promotion and Regional Integration) license to a newly founded private airline named North Air last week to enhance tourism.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Schedule of Flights</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sadpara Air Safari, renamed after the great mountaineer Ali Sadpara, would take off every Saturday from the New Islamabad Airport and fly over the snow-capped summits of K2, Nanga Parbat, and the beautiful Saif ul Maluk lake.

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">The national flag carrier of Pakistan has been ranked as one of the best airlines in the whole world that also offer PIA flights by ensuring the safety of travellers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a time when PIA was known to be the best airline in the whole world. The country''s national flag carrier is getting back to its previous rankings, and in the last two decades, things went gone. That’s because it has now been ranked as one of the <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/flights">best airlines in Pakistan</a> and worldwide.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the PIA flight tickets that passengers buy are also considered safe because the airline has also received safety ratings from Europe. It is one of the country''s biggest national flag carrier achievements, and if you are a citizen of Pakistan, you should be proud of this amazing news.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to know more about it, then consider reading this post till the very end. You can book cheap flights with the PIA''s confidence to travel to your favourite destinations without worrying about safety. So, let’s jump into it.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PIA is one of the Safest Airlines in the World</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The officials from the country''s national flag carrier, PIA (Pakistan International Airlines), have recently announced that the PIA has successfully managed to achieve the rank of being one of the best airlines in the entire world. The officials also mentioned that the PIA flights have also achieved the perfect safest ratings from Europe.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It was achieved after the audit that the SAFA (Safety Audit for Foreign-Origin Aircraft), a safety watchdog, performed the airline''s audit. SAFA is a European company that rates different airlines in the world based on their safety measures.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SAFA Audits</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Safety Audit for Foreign-Origin Aircraft performs the safety audits periodically and checks all the airlines that are not based in Europe. The company has its teams in different airports across the globe. It performed the safety measures of PIA flights. The company was observing the national carrier of Pakistan since the scandal regarding the license of pilots rose. Keep in mind that the company performed an extensive audit of the airline flights of the country''s national flag carrier.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SAFA recorded no Findings</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">However, because Safety Audit for Foreign-Origin Aircraft has recorded zero finds in the previous few weeks, it has reduced its safety danger index to 0, a flawless score. The chief executive officer of the national flag carrier and the retired Air Marshal, Mr. Arshad Malik, expressed his gratitude to Almighty Allah for the countless blessings and complimented the Pakistan International Airlines team on their earnest efforts in earning the best safety ratings.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remarks of the CEO of PIA</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Arshad Malik stated that, after the restructure of the Safety Department of <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/pakistan-international-airlines-flights"><strong>Pakistan International Airlines</strong></a>, more severe in-house safety inspections are now being performed on all foreign flights. In Pakistan International Airlines, an entirely new culture regarding safety awareness and standards has been properly implemented, with special career incentives and focus offered to staff. They adhere to the culture and ensure safety in each PIA online flight or any other.</p>', N'pia-has-been-ranked-as-one-of-the-best-airlines-in-the-world', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 797, 1, CAST(N'2021-11-08T07:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best things about traveling, no matter where you are, is trying new foods, and <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/etihad-airways-flights"><strong>Etihad Airlines flights</strong></a> allow you to experience different cultures, foods, and places. Every country and city has its must-try list - and Toronto is no exception. It is a city of many cultures, each bringing its flavor to Toronto''s varied and exciting food scene. There''s always something great to eat in the city, from food trucks and stalls to bar snacks and fine dining. With that in mind, whether you live in Toronto, or are visiting for the first or fifth time, here are some of the dishes you must try in Toronto.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gran Fritto Misto</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The plate of gran Fritto Misto in this casual setting in Little Italy, intended for shared use, is a decadent mess of fried snacks. In a golden and perfectly crispy pile, you can find rapini, zucchini, cauliflower, many other seasonal vegetables, arancini, and a changing list of seafood. Everything is hot from the refrigerator, a special fryer imported from Naples.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Macarons</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A rainbow of pastel macaroons await behind the glass counters of Nadège Patisserie and while there are plenty of sweet treats to choose from, all worth trying, the perfectly delicate macaroons are hard to resist and limiting to one is a lot harder than it sounds. The flavors change, but you can expect more unique offerings like cotton candy, rose or match a green tea, and raspberry, among more traditional offerings like chocolate, vanilla, and salted caramel. If you are from Pakistan, you can easily find LHE YYZ flights that are the carrier of your choice because these flights are readily available.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jerk Lobster</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Toronto hosts many Chinese and Jamaican restaurants. However, Chef Craig Wong''s Dundas West is the only place to combine both culinary influences into one menu seamlessly. Patois Toronto''s most favorite dish is the Lobster Prosperity Jerk. It was originally served as a Lunar New Year special, but when Wong tried to pull it off the menu, a commotion broke out, making the dish a permanent home.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Wok-fried Hong Kong-style lobster is first cooked in court broth. It is then added to homemade Jamaican jerk paste and a healthy dose of butter and topped with a fresh hit of coriander and lime.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rasta Pasta</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Fusion cuisine is a classic dish worldwide, but the Italian-Jamaican couple, Rasta noodles, guarantees a double dose. Jamaican influence comes from co-owner Magnus Patterson, and Italian slim comes from his co-owner and associate Mary Neglia. Follow Jamaican steel drums'' sounds that lure passers-by and order reggae lasagna. Traditional Italian layers of ricotta, mozzarella, and fresh pasta flirting with spicy tomato sauce and steamed squid are served.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Churros</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyone craving something sweet while in Toronto should consider going to one of the two Panchos Bakery locations for a freshly fried churro. Here, you''ll be served with decadent deep-fried dough sticks coated in cinnamon and sugar and then filled with a variety of fillings ranging from chocolate to caramel and jam. Chocolate is especially delicious, but you can also get it plain. Whenever you take your Etihad Airlines flights to Toronto, do not miss Churros at all costs.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nanaimo Bar</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The three-layer no-bake cake is named after Nanaimo in British Columbia, but the sweet delicacy has become the country''s unofficial national dessert. No one knows where it came from, but since the recipe became popular in the 1950s, a blend of powdered pudding, graham cracker crumbs, and cocoa has hit the shelves of coffee shops gourmet menus. Distillery District, a Brick Street Bakery dealer, is the perfect version - best enjoyed while walking along the area''s cobbled streets.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Margherita pizza</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You can probably debate for days about where to get the best Margherita pizza in Toronto, but the North Brooklyn cakes are hard to beat. Everything is made from local ingredients, resulting in a crispy crust with the right amount of chewing and a sauce that provides the right acidity for creamy mozzarella. If you''re really hungry, order garlic knots made from leftover dough and spread with garlic butter.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Taking <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/flights/cheap-flights-from-lahore-to-toronto"><strong>LHE YYZ Flights</strong></a> is one of the easiest ways to experience cultural beauty and, most importantly, Toronto''s food for all the Pakistanis.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Belgian fries</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Fresh fries aren''t difficult in most cities, and Toronto is no exception. Not all types of fries are cooked equally, and we all know it. Spuds are Belgian-style fried, meaning they are thick, golden, crispy, and fluffy inside. For an extra dollar, they can be fried in beef fat, which is highly recommended. Oh, and forget the usual ketchup. There are 18 different homemade sauces to decorate your fries with.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Khao Soi</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Creamy, flavorful, and fun to eat, Pai Northern Kitchen''s Khao soy is often described as better than what people remember eating in Thailand. Fresh egg noodles are swimming in a golden curry with crispy noodles, coriander, green onions, and a choice of braised beef, prawns, chicken breast, or chicken drumsticks. Whether you''ve been to Northern Thailand or not, feel like you''ve been transported with this uniquely aromatic dish.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These are some of the best food items you should try in Toronto with Etihad Airlines flights. Regardless of the reason why you are traveling to Canada, these dishes cannot be missed. Whether you are going alone, with friends or with family, make sure you take them with you whenever you visit Toronto.</p>', N'best-food-items-you-should-try-in-toronto-with-etihad-airlines', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 463, 1, CAST(N'2020-10-05T11:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

That’s why airports from all across the globe are also applying new precautionary measures to make sure that all the passengers remain safe.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But should we buy their trust</span>?</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At the start of the pandemic, people infected with the virus boarded planes and rapidly spread epidemics around the world. But whether planes were a dangerous place to contaminate and infect others was a more open question. In all actuality, we don''t have the foggiest idea about the appropriate response yet. There are several high-quality studies on aircraft transmission, and they all contain important caveats and uncertainties.</p>

The timetable system, which has not yet been adopted, aims to improve the flow of passengers through the lines of the Transport Safety Administration and other narrow points.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enhanced Ventilation System</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Consortium individuals additionally state that air terminals can decrease the danger of infection spreading by expanding wind current in terminals and redesigning existing warming, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) frameworks to move through bright light, slaughtering airborne infections.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These changes, coupled with the strict enforcement of the wearing of masks, can make a difference. She pointed out that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organisation recommend increasing ventilation in buildings.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Self-Serve Contactless Systems</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Facial recognition technology, which has already been tested to confirm the identity of foreign travelers, should also be used for domestic travelers. These systems are applied in both conditions while getting affordable airline tickets and while boarding. It reduces the need for travelers to have close contact with security or airline employees to confirm their identity or on-board status. If airlines and government agencies share who is flying, airports could create a facial recognition system that allows travelers to fly through the airport without stopping.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Air Bridges</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">One idea is to create a so-called airlift between international destinations that agree to require passengers flying between them to undergo testing or other screening for symptoms of COVID-19. Consortium members hope that testing and pre-screening can reduce the risk of the virus spreading across borders and boost the demand for international travel. However, health officials noted that pre-flight testing has limitations as some travelers may test negative shortly after being infected and before the virus has had a chance to reproduce.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mask Wearing</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Three of the mass-broadcast cases in which more than one person was infected. Recent studies show these results during flights at the start of the pandemic when masking was not mandatory. On the other hand, on a flight from Dubai to Hong Kong, which carried 27 passengers infected with the coronavirus, universal masking was in place and only two people were infected. Regardless of your ticket type whether it''s affordable airline tickets or luxury ones, you’ll have to abide by these rules.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">One of them sat in a row with five people diagnosed with the virus upon arrival. The clues are extremely strong that the mass transmission events we know about really stopped happening after the airlines started introducing some form of cloaking. Wearing glasses or a face shield to cover your eyes is probably even more protective although face shields do not replace masks.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These are some of the most significant precautionary measures that airports are taking to control the transmission of COVID-19. These rules are mostly applied and are strictly being followed in the west and you have to comply with these whenever you take <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/flights/cheap-flights-from-lahore-to-los-angeles"><strong>LHE to LAX Cheap Flights</strong></a>.</p>', N'airports-are-trying-to-make-flying-feel-safe-during-the-pandemic', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 492, 1, CAST(N'2020-11-27T10:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">As the effects of the COVID-19 are mitigating slowly from some parts of the world the rules and requirements of those places are also changing. Some airlines are trying to get their travelers back by offering <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>cheap airline tickets</strong></a>. On the other hand, some of them are offering very great flight deals. It’s all because of the global pandemic. Very recently one of the major airlines of the world has announced that it will be resuming its flight to some restricted places.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, it’s about none other than Turkish Airlines. Now you can grab your Turkish airline flight reservation from Abu Dhabi to Istanbul which was stopped due to coronavirus. Keep on reading to find out the details of this news.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The News</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Flights between Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are due to resume in days for the first time since the pandemic forced authorities to close airports earlier this year.Emirates will resume daily flights between Dubai and Istanbul in a week, it said in a statement Monday. According to a company spokesman, this is after Fly Dubai resumed service on Thursday.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Turkish Airlines are also planning to return in the days with its Turkish Airline flight reservation availability for Abu Dhabi and Istanbul travelers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Turkish Airlines and Emirates have suspended flights between their two hubs despite both carriers reviving their impoverished pandemic flight schedules. While neither airline said why services remained suspended, the protracted hold coincided with a deterioration in relations between the two nations.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It Might Repair the Relationship of the Two Countries</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The United Arab Emirates and Turkey are on opposite sides of a proxy war in Libya and disagree on issues from Syria and Iraq to the eastern Mediterranean. Like their close ally Saudi Arabia, the UAE sees Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan''s version of political Islam as a destabilising influence in the region.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The arranged resumption of flights proposes that strains among Turkey and the UAE are dying down. Saudi Arabia and Turkish leaders last month agreed to keep their channels for dialogue open. The four to five-hour journey from Dubai to Istanbul was one of Emirates'' busiest routes. For Turkish Airlines, the corridor was a welcome way to attract frugal passengers heading to Western Europe or North America via the new Istanbul airport.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What we Hope</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We also hope the same that the resumption of <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/turkish-airlines-flights"><strong>Turkish airline flight reservation</strong></a> for UAE’s travelers will help both of the countries to resolve their conflicts. Although the conflicts are on a very rough surface it’s the same thing about somewhere to start. As the people now will start taking cheap airline tickets, both of the countries will have to collaborate with each other and it might bring the old harmony back.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As the Airline itself Says!</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After a moment of absence, we return to heaven. As a result of our meticulous work with national and international health authorities, the management of the airline regain-sits loved ones, discoveries, and memories that can be gathered during flights with healthier and safer standards. The company is happy to offer flexible travel options as it knows how difficult it is to plan during this period. Passengers can make unlimited changes to tickets made between 21st March 2020 and 31st March 2021.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The flight plan shows scheduled flights that will be operated until January 31st. As the airline’s flight plan is updated, it will make it available for the travelers.</p>', N'turkish-airlines-will-be-resuming-weekly-4-flights-from-abu-dhabi-to-istanbul', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 477, 1, CAST(N'2020-12-22T09:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

<p style="text-align: justify;">Jeddah remains a safe and dynamic place for tourists, and we have come up with the most interesting facts about Jeddah. Read them, and you won''t be able to keep yourself from visiting Jeddah.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Different Names of Jeddah Tower</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Jeddah Tower was not originally called that way. The first names it received were the Mile-High Tower and Kingdom Tower. Then the Mile-High was changed and renamed Jeddah Tower because the building itself would not be one mile in total. The building sure will reach the digit of one but only in terms of kilometres.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Jeddah Tower represents a desert plant soaring upwards, symbolizing Saudi Arabia''s development and future.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Highest Building in the World</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Numerous nations worldwide might want to guarantee that they have the tallest structure universally. However, in 2019, the honor will be given to Saudi Arabia. Jeddah Tower in Jeddah will soar through the clouds to a height of 3,280 feet, which is more than Burj Khalifa. Designed by Adrian Smith and Gordon Gill from Chicago, it will be the first building in the world to reach a height of one kilometre. The overall cost of this project is expected to be over one billion US dollars.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jeddah Waterfront</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Jeddah is situated on the shores of the Red Sea. The total coastal area is approximately 30 km long. More than 4 km, near Al-Nawras Square, was renovated at the cost of SR 800 million in 2018 and named Jeddah Waterfront. It features water sports parks, beaches, children''s play parks, interactive water fountains, restaurants, kiosks, a floating marina, animal and art sculptures, as well as dozens of dedicated toilets and phone charging stations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a must-see, especially for children who can enjoy the slides, swings, and beautifully designed entertainment zones where adults can sit and enjoy a pleasant time. Those who want to walk or cycle have a designated area between the two sides of the road.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a must-visit place in Jeddah. Make sure you take your family and kids with you whenever you take Saudi Arabia Flights to Jeddah.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Airport</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since we heard that the Jeddah airport would be expanded, we Jeddah cannot stop raving about it. The airport will occupy a vast area of 670,000 square meters. The airport expansion project is part of the GACA 2020 strategy, which aims to develop 27 national, regional, and international airports in the Kingdom.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The project will be implemented in three stages. In the first phase, Jeddah airport will be able to handle 30 million passengers. In the second phase, the capacity will increase to 45 million.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The total cost of the Jeddah airport expansion project is estimated at approximately SR 43 billion. It is expected to use approximately 3,100 tons of steel for its construction.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fakieh Aquarium</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The only public aquarium in Saudi Arabia started operating in 2013. With over 200 marine life species, including sharks, groupies, string rays, Napoleon wrasse, and seahorses, Murrays is a unique tourist attraction in the city.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Families can also participate in the dolphin show, which takes place twice a day. The dolphin show''s cost is paid independently and is discretionary. However, it is a completely suggested vacation destination in Jeddah.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GDP</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">About 45% of Saudi Arabia''s GDP comes from the oil sector, generating more than $ 300 billion, more than the combined GDP of Iraq, Morocco, Tonga, and Rwanda. However, as part of a key effort to diversify the economy, six new "economic cities" are being built. They will bring millions of new jobs and are projected to add $150 billion to GDP, 3.5 times Kenya''s total GDP.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Jeddah is a multicultural city. You can find true Continental, Asian, Mexican, Western, and Arabic cuisine. Despite Jeddah''s food and international food chains'' amazing authenticity, I recommend trying the local Jeddah dishes. Jeddah''s most popular restaurant chain is Al-Baik, offering various chicken and seafood dishes, but known for its signature roast chicken.</p>

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">The shoulder season is travel industry jargon which is specified for the tenure of seasons. The year divides in to three major seasons according to travel jargon, such as: Peak season, off season and shoulder season. Shoulder season can be explained as the duration between the September to November and Easter to early June (it’s found between the peak and off-season months), in actual sense, say that shoulder season are found time two times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This season is best for <a href="https://blog.faremakers.com/Blog/2019/1/28/deal-of-the-day-faremakers">visiting Europe if you want to save money on travel</a>, you can avail best travel deals and warm (comfortable) weather. This season is that time in which you can learn more, seeing more, no more tourist (fewer tourist tenure given more opportunities to you for gaining, experiences, learning more) and cheap accommodation facilities. Here are my reasons for thinking that the shoulder season is best time to visit Europe.</p>

<h3>Changing The Season:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tourists/travelers feel the mellow weather and on other words the one more attractive word help you to define the changing of the season in Europe and that is beautiful. Europe looks like very beautiful and soft fine in the shoulder season. The atmosphere is very warm like a comfortable surrounding over the Europe. You will feel very relax and easy in this climate, appreciate able walk easily done in this season no fear of snow falling or rain, street and road are quite clear and its silence generate special calm that touches your soul and even all attraction sites look pretty and calls you to visit without any unpredictable atmosphere changes.</p>

<h3>No Crowd:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The visiting Europe in shoulder season is the ever best time whole the year because it save your time.  Very less amount of tourist are found in shoulder season therefore you do not need to wait in a long queues to go in the museum or any historic or heritage location, no need to wait to explore their adventure just go and do anything what-ever you want without any time hurdle. You enjoy every street or road without puzzle on crowd. You will feel like you are alone single person on the Europe’s streets to explore it.</p>

<h3>Best Time Of Photos:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The shoulder seasons are also a better time to get photographs of many attractions. You’ll face fewer tourists that may disturb your photos otherwise you can take your Photos and seeing locations. This time is easily avail your pictures of all sights which attracts you, no other one reserve that due to no more tourists.</p>

<h3>Cheap Flights:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This season is perfect for money saving due to less number tourists and travelers moved this country. Therefore airlines prices less as compare to other seasons. In this season you can get <strong><a href="https://www.faremakers.com/">Cheap Airline Tickets</a></strong> in Pakistan to celebrate your travel and learning more. This segment is the very preferable for saving according flights. Even you get your favorite airline in your desirable dates due to fewer passengers.</p>

<h3>Affordable Accommodation:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Transport fare in the city is also very low due to less visitors and no hassle &amp; bustle on the roads. Hotel and cab services charges too smooth and reasonable. Hotel reservation easily done, many discounted deal also offer you with proper complete package. This duration is good for living in hotels and visit restaurants to taste new flavors in affordable rates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shoulder season is complete and ever best time. Specially  for those who want to see Europe in alone time and in cheap budget. You can get leverage of lonely streets, cheap hotels &amp; accommodation, less crowd, open all places and warm weather to walk openly on the roads to get pleasure from every leave or air-stem that touches you.</p>', N'why-shoulder-season-is-best-to-visit-europe', N'Aqsa Tayyaba', NULL, 1225, 1, CAST(N'2019-03-30T15:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated Anas:</p>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people." (See Hadith No. 409, Vol 9).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated Anas:</p>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people." (See Hadith No. 409, Vol 9).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "I have made Medina a sanctuary between its two (Harrat) mountains." The Prophet (ﷺ) went to the tribe of Bani Haritha and said (to them), "I see that you have gone out of the sanctuary," but looking around, he added, "No, you are inside the sanctuary."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated `Ali:</p>
<p>We have nothing except the Book of Allah and this written paper from the Prophet (wherein is written:) Medina is a sanctuary from the ''Air Mountain to such and such a place, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits a sin, or gives shelter to such an innovator in it will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted. And the asylum (of protection) granted by any Muslim is to be secured (respected) by all the other Muslims; and whoever betrays a Muslim in this respect incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted, and whoever (freed slave) befriends (take as masters) other than his manumitters without their permission incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p>Allah''s Messenger (ﷺ) said, "I was ordered to migrate to a town which will swallow (conquer) other towns and is called Yathrib and that is Medina, and it turns out (bad) persons as a furnace removes the impurities of iron.</p>

<p><br /> </p>
<p>Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I heard Allah''s Messenger (ﷺ) saying, "The people will leave Medina in spite of the best state it will have, and none except the wild birds and the beasts of prey will live in it, and the last persons who will die will be two shepherds from the tribe of Muzaina, who will be driving their sheep towards Medina, but will find nobody in it, and when they reach the valley of Thaniyat-al-Wada`, they will fall down on their faces dead."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated Sufyan b. Abu Zuhair:</p>
<p>I heard Allah''s Messenger (ﷺ) saying, "Yemen will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and those who will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew.

<p>Narrated Sa`d:</p>
<p>I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) saying, "None plots against the people of Medina but that he will be dissolved (destroyed) like the salt is dissolved in water."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated Usama:</p>
<p>Once the Prophet (ﷺ) stood at the top of a (looked out from upon one) castle amongst the castles (or the high buildings) of Medina and said, "Do you see what I see? (No doubt) I see the spots where afflictions will take place among your houses (and these afflictions will be) as numerous as the spots where raindrops fall."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:</p>
<p>Allah''s Messenger (ﷺ) told us a long narrative about Ad-Dajjal, and among the many things he mentioned, was his saying, "Ad-Dajjal will come and it will be forbidden for him to pass through the entrances of Medina. He will land in some of the salty barren areas (outside) Medina; on that day the best man or one of the best men will come up to him and say, ''I testify that you are the same Dajjal whose description was given to us by Allah''s Messenger (ﷺ) .'' Ad-Dajjal will say to the people, ''If I kill this man and bring him back to life again, will you doubt my claim?'' They will say, ''No.'' Then Ad-Dajjal will kill that man and bring him back to life. That man will say, ''Now I know your reality better than before.'' Ad-Dajjal will say, ''I want to kill him but I cannot.''</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p>A bedouin came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and gave a pledge of allegiance for embracing Islam. The next day he came with fever and said (to the Prophet (ﷺ) ), "Please cancel my pledge (of embracing Islam and of emigrating to Medina)." The Prophet (ﷺ) refused (that request) three times and said, "Medina is like a furnace, it expels out the impurities (bad persons) and selects the good ones and makes them perfect."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated Anas:</p>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "O Allah! Bestow on Medina twice the blessings You bestowed on Mecca."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated Anas:</p>
<p>Whenever the Prophet (ﷺ) returned from a journey and observed the walls of Medina, he would make his Mount go fast, and if he was on an animal (i.e. a horse), he would make it gallop because of his love for Medina.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated Anas:</p>
<p>(The people of) Bani Salama intended to shift near the mosque (of the Prophet) but Allah''s Messenger (ﷺ) disliked to see Medina vacated and said, "O the people of Bani Salama! Don''t you think that you will be rewarded for your footsteps which you take towards the mosque?" So, they stayed at their old places.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated `Aisha:</p>
<p>When Allah''s Messenger (ﷺ) reached Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal became ill. When Abu Bakr''s fever got worse, he would recite (this poetic verse): "Everybody is staying alive with his People, yet Death is nearer to him than His shoe laces." And Bilal, when his fever deserted him, would recite: "Would that I could stay overnight in A valley wherein I would be Surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (kinds of goodsmelling grass). Would that one day I could Drink the water of the Majanna, and Would that (The two mountains) Shama and Tafil would appear to me!" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "O Allah! Curse Shaiba bin Rabi`a and `Utba bin Rabi`a and Umaiya bin Khalaf as they turned us out of our land to the land of epidemics." Allah''s Messenger (ﷺ) then said, "O Allah! Make us love Medina as we love Mecca or even more than that. O Allah! Give blessings in our Sa and our Mudd (measures symbolizing food) and make the climate of Medina suitable for us, and divert its fever towards Aljuhfa." Aisha added: When we reached Medina, it was the most unhealthy of Allah''s lands, and the valley of Bathan (the valley of Medina) used to flow with impure colored water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated Zaid bin Aslam from his father:</p>
<p>`Umar said, O Allah! Grant me martyrdom in Your cause, and let my death be in the city of Your Apostle."</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The travel ban on all direct passenger and business air ticket booking from Pakistan as well as from India has been extended by Canada for another 30 days, until June 21, 2021.The travel ban was implemented on April 22nd for a period of 30 days, ending on May 22nd. Vaccines and safety equipment will continue to be transported by cargo flights into Canada.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It''s possible that passengers will still be able to fly to Canada. They''ll have to do so in a roundabout way, requiring a COVID-19 test at their last point of departure.At a government pandemic briefing on May 21, Canada''s transport minister, Omar Alghabra, reported the news.Last week, Air Canada extended the flight ban to India, anticipating a government announcement. Pakistan is not served by the airline.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The World is Concerned About the New Covid-19 Variants</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada''s deputy chief public health officer, emphasized the relevance of the travel restrictions, stating that about 70 percent of new COVID-19 cases are variants of concern. It''s important to have these safeguards in place before going for <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>air ticket booking</strong></a>.</p>
 
The airline understands that, while the importation of variants is a small part of what''s going on in Canada, everything we can do to add another layer of protection is critical at this time.B.1.6.1.7 is the name of the Indian version. 279 passengers tested positive for this new model between February 22 and May 6. Inside Canada, there may also be group transmission.</p>

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Solo travel has become a compelling mode of tourism especially in the 21st century. It may seem that solo traveling is not as entertaining as traveling with someone; however, the reality is entirely different. Traveling alone through <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/turkish-airlines-flights   "><strong>Turkish Airline Booking</strong></a> will give you an amazing opportunity to burst your solitude and find compassion among the strangers in far off lands.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If done with proper care and thought, solo traveling offers rich dividends, and it will undoubtedly prove to be a life-changing moment. Here, we have elaborated on some critical things that you must know while traveling alone.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">From shopping and dining out to touring and exploring, this guide will ensure that all of your solo trip endeavors go without a hook.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Try To Do Small Activities Alone</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Before embarking on a solo trip, you need to experience some critical things in your own town. For example, you can go to a local restaurant and start eating on your own. You should also be trying to do shopping alone so that you could get a hands-on experience of the activities that you are going to do during your trip.  In this way, you would not get worried while traveling abroad by Turkish Airline Booking.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Understand The Culture Of The Place You Are Entering</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You might fall victim to some embarrassing misconceptions if you enter a new place without knowing its culture. Different countries have different rules for tourists, and you must need to know when to become formal.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, if you are planning your next trip to UAE, then keep in mind that capturing the shots of government buildings might land you behind bars. Similarly, in Iran, it is not allowed to show affection in public places. Hence, it is always conducive to read the general guidelines before landing on a new country.</p>

<strong>Must Read:</strong> <a style="color:Purple;" href="https://blog.faremakers.com/Blog/2019/10/25/air-traveling-becomes-easy-with-faremakers   "><strong>Traveling Becomes Easy With Faremakers</strong></a>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Know Where You Are Going</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Make sure to check in advance the maps of the area where you are traveling. It is imperative to get in-depth knowhow of all the routes of your destination in order to avoid going astray. Furthermore, do not behave like a person who knows nothing. If people realize that you are a new traveler and you have no idea about the locations, then they might exploit your gentleness.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, if possible, try to learn the language that is spoken by all the people. In this way, you will be able to communicate with foreigners conveniently.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Keep The Emergency Contact Info</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In your home country, you can easily call the police in case of an emergency. But in a foreign country, you can only call the police if you know their contact number. Many countries have separate numbers for medical or crime emergencies. So, it is crucial to save the emergency contact numbers in your mobile or note them down in case your phone dies. Also, tell your family and friends how to reach you in an emergency.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don’t Over-Pack</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no need to stuff your bag with irrelevant things. Throughout the journey, you have to carry the bag by yourself, and overstuffing that bag will certainly exhaust your energies. To save space, you can plan different outfits using the same pieces. Furthermore, you should also be bringing only two pairs of shoes for the whole journey and shuffle them in time of need.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don’t Run Out Of Cash</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You cannot afford to start your journey with empty pockets. It is ok to sleep on a bench or ask strangers for help while traveling with your friends; however, while traveling solo by Turkish Airline Booking, you should certainly not ask for the free rides or sleeping beds. No one is behind your back, and going out of cash will be catastrophic for your enjoyment. In addition to this, you will also not be able to taste the food of your choice or buy your favorite clothes.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Diana Schoenbru, a renowned author, wrote in the Oct 4 edition of Washington Post that traveling alone for the first time was both thrilling and anxiety-inducing for her. She articulated her views in the paper to urge other people for solo traveling. Like her, we also urge you to do solo traveling at least once in your life.

As we do fasting in the month of Ramadan same we should fasting in this month to get more blessing of Allah because it is the right month to gather more blessing of Allah by good deeds and fasting. You must perform Umrah in this month and turn your double rewards in thousands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hazrat Moosa also fasted on the 10<sup>th</sup> Muharam, because Allah saved their nation’s children. Therefore, His nation followed him and fasted in this day. Hazrat Abbas (RA) narrates:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“<u>The Prophet (PBUH) came to Madina and saw the Jews fasting on the day of Ashoora. He said, ‘What is this?’ They said, ‘This is a righteous day, it is the day when Allah saved the Children of Israel from their enemies, so Moosa fasted on this day.’ He said, ‘We have more right to Moosa than you,’ so He fasted on that day and commanded (the Muslims) to fast on that day</u>”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before Islam, all before nations have a strong faith in this month. Allah blessed every before and after nations for the bounties of Muharam. Every nation gets success on this day either by saving Israel child or martyred Hazrat Husain (R.A)</p>

<h3><strong><u>Youm-E- Ashura</u></strong><strong><u>:</u></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ashura is the 10<sup>th</sup> of Muharram when last Messenger’s grandson and his family sacrificed their lives just for raise Islam and remains Islam till the Dooms-day. Hazrat Husain (R.A) and his companions just follow the Hazrat Muhammad’s lesson in Karbala and get Success even after cut their heads by the Yazid people.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“<u>I never saw the Messenger of Allah so keen to fast any day and give it priority over any other time than the day of Ashoora and the month of Ramadan</u>.”(</strong>Bukhari)</p>
From this Hadith is clear that Messenger of Allah aware from this day before time and He took fasting and pray to Almighty for His grandsons and His Ummat.  That’s why we avoid celebrating all cheerful events in this month and distributing sweet milk, sweet dishes, Haleem or other dishes for the commemoration of Karbala.

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Qatar is a small Muslim country located in the Persian Gulf. Each year, millions of travel enthusiasts come to Qatar and enjoy the stunning beauty of this country. In 2018, more than 1.8 million foreign visitors came to Qatar despite a blocked imposed by its four neighboring states. In addition to this, Qatar is hosting the Football World Cup 2022, and it is estimated that more than 4 million foreigners will come here through <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/   "><strong>Cheap Flight Tickets</strong></a> to watch world cup the matches.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Doha is the capital of Qatar and is termed as the jewel in crown. Picturesque architecture and scenic views of Doha allure millions of people each year. It does not matter where you want to go in Doha, respecting local traditions and laws is imperative. Here, we have delineated all the essential things which must be followed if you want to seamlessly enjoy the splendor of Doha.</p>

<h3>1.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Weather</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">During the summer months, the atmosphere of Doha becomes extremely hot as temperatures generally go around 50. If you are coming from snowy or cold countries, then the extreme temperatures are way too much for you. Actually, Doha is cordoned off by deserts, and the scorching sun can exhaust you anytime. So, it would be conducive if you don’t come to Doha in summers.</p>

<h3>2.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Month Of Ramadan</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the month of Ramadan, drinking and eating in public places is strictly prohibited. Moreover, all the shops, supermarkets, and restaurants are closed during the day. It is because Qatari authorities have immense respect for the month of Ramadan. So, if you are a foreign tourist and are planning a visit to Doha by cheap flight tickets, then make sure that it is not the month of Ramadan. Otherwise, it would not be possible for you to fully enjoy the Clamor of Doha.</p>

<h3>3.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dress Code</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Qatar is an Islamic country, and most of the laws have been made as per the teachings of Shariah. In Doha, it is advised by the authorities to wear respectful clothes.  Even though Hijab is not mandatory in most of the places, however, it is always smarter to dress conservatively. Generally, foreign tourists don’t adhere to the customs of Qatar, and as a result, they end up being penalized by the officials. You can wear whatever you want indoors, but try to show some modesty in public places.</p>

<h3>4.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conveyance</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no concept of public transport in Doha. You can go to one place to another either in your car or by taxi. Furthermore, you can also not get around on foot, given that Doha is not a pedestrian-friendly city. In the daytime, the streets depict a deafening silence, and so, it becomes even harder to find a taxi. So, always remember to book a taxi in advance before taking your foot out of the hotel.</p>

<h3>5.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drinking Alcohol In Doha</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Alcohol cannot be consumed publicly, and you can only buy it in the hotels. Moreover, it is also not allowed to bring alcohol into the country while traveling through cheap flight tickets. If the authorities find the drinks in your possession, then you would be strictly penalized.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, alcohol is also not available on the standard restaurants given that it is highly expensive. You can only find it in the lavish restaurants, and that is too in the inflated prices.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>:</h3>

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Pakistan is planning to launch a brand new airline to offer cheap flights for the people who love to travel. It will promote the country’s tourism greatly.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Pakistan is one of the most beautiful countries in the whole world, and people from all over the world book <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>cheap flights to Pakistan</strong></a> to witness its beauty. Now the country is planning to launch another airline that will be helping people with tourism. There are already many cheap airlines in the country, and the most popular one is Pakistan International Airlines. The name of the new airline is finalized to be North Air because it will be helping people to enjoy the northern beauty of the country.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Licensing of the New Airline</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The country''s CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) has already issued the TPRI (Tourism Promotion and Regional Integration) license to the new airline of the country. It’s important to note that the airline has initially announced that it will offer cheap flight tickets to Gwadar, Gilgit, Chitral, Skardu, and Islamabad.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Keep in mind that these are some of the most popular destinations that people like to use in the whole country. Pakistanis and international tourists book airline flights of their choice to Pakistan to visit these places.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Founder of the Airline</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The new airline “North Air” is one of the most successful businessmen, Raja Nazeem ul Ameen). The founder said that getting the license is one of the biggest milestones so far that the airline has achieved. Now it will be able to comply with all the requirements of the CAA of the country. It includes training capacity, technical staff, pilots, and the reviewing of the aircraft.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Promotion of Tourism</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest goal of the airline is to improve tourism in the country that will also help the economy grow. Not only will this new airline improve national tourism, but it will also help Pakistan with international tourism.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Planes That Will be Used</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The founder said that initially, the airline was planning to offer cheap flights with a couple of Bombardier Q400 planes. It is important to note that these aircraft are yet to be purchased, and North Air will be the first airline in the country to offer cheap online flights for these aircraft.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These aircraft need short landing and take-off capabilities which is ideal for the northern areas. It works perfectly well for all the GB runways once aircraft can easily carry about 80 travellers and cover long distances.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s important to note that Pakistan International Airlines have ATR 72 and 42 that offer the traveler capacity of 70 and 48, respectively. So, the new airline will have more capacity in one flight, which means more people will book cheap airline flight tickets.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is undoubtedly a piece of interesting news for the country, and we hope that this new airline will promote the tourism of Pakistan beyond the borders.</p>', N'pakistan-plans-to-launch-a-new-airline-to-promote-tourism', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 134, 1, CAST(N'2021-10-01T06:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PIA Special Flights and COVID-19 Vaccination</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Pakistan International Airlines scheduled two different Special PIA flights to send to China. The purpose of these special cargo flights was to bring a new batch of COVID-19 vaccines to Pakistan. The number of doses in this batch is 5.9 million. The flights took off from the Islamabad International Airport to Beijing International, loaded all the vaccine doses, and returned to the capital on 7th September 2021.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This information is only about the latest batch, and the flights PK-6853 and PK-6852 were used for this operation. It is important to note that the Pakistan International Airline has successfully contacted similar programs to airlift the COVID-10 vaccination doses.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Previous COVID-19 Vaccination Batch</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Four different PIA special flights went to China in the previous program and brought back 12 million COVID-19 vaccination doses. The national air flag carrier''s flights for that operation were PK-6856, PK-6854, PK-6853, and-6852. In that batch, the vaccine was Sinovac which is one of the most effective vaccines. The government is now urging all the citizens of the country to take their doses as soon as possible to control the danger of the virus’s spread.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Current Vaccination Situation in the Country</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you don’t already know, then Pakistan International Airline has brought more than 63 million COVID-19 vaccination doses to the country. The national flag carrier has also conducted multiple programs, and so far, 49 special PIA special flights have been used for this purpose. The government of Pakistan has set the target to vaccinate at least 75 million people across the country by the end of this year. For the mass vaccination drive, the government uses multiple types of vaccines made in China, including CanSino, Sinovac, Sinopharm, etcetera.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vaccination Driver in Pakistan</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In March of this year, the health authorities began a countrywide immunization push using about a million doses of Sinopharm vaccine supplied by China, beginning with older people and front-line healthcare professionals.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The country''s government started with a primary focus on the community''s elderly, typically those over the age of 80. Still, the vaccine is now being provided to anybody over the age of 18. On February 1, a military aircraft delivered the first Covid-19 vaccination cargo from Beijing to Islamabad.</p>', N'pia-special-flights-brought-more-covid-19-doses-from-china', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 143, 1, CAST(N'2021-09-14T06:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

	</div>


</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2019, Pakistan performed exceptionally well in the tourism sector. The country has superseded various other countries in enticing the tourists from all across the globe. Recently, Forbes magazine has declared Pakistan in the best “Under-the-Radar” trips of 2020. Similarly, various other reputable agencies of Europe and the Gulf have praised the concerted efforts of the successive governments to solidify the tourism sector.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though the tourism sector is magically booming in Pakistan, the existing anomalies and shortcomings must be paid heed to if the country wants to retain the unprecedented status in the years ahead. The complacency on the part of security agencies and government will certainly take the country back to point zero. Here, we are going to discuss some guidelines that will help the country to achieve sustainable growth in the tourism industry.</p>

<h3>1.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consistent Delivery Of Services</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Consistent delivery of services is pivotal to maintain the flow of people to famous tourist destinations. Indeed, the delivery of quality services is considered the benchmark for the success of a place. For example, there are still various places in Pakistan that do not have the proper infrastructure of hotels. People have to utilize expensive transports to reach the primary tourist hubs. So, if the government establishes the hotels near the major tourist points, then people will not hesitate to take their feet out of their homes. Similarly, they would also be able to save money, which they can use for other recreational activities.</p>

<h3>2.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Classification Of Hotels</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We know that the hotels in Pakistan mislead the people by boasting the so-called quality of their services. They try to woo the tourists by claiming that they have all the amenities, but in reality, they lack even the essential services. Just to charge the hefty sums, the hotel owners cleverly put their hotels in the list of 4-star or 5-star hotels. So, the government must classify the hotels as per the type of services and operations offered. The country cannot elevate the level of accommodation if there are no checks and balances in place. The government must ensure that the hotels are following a transparent framework.</p>

<h3>3.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Facilitating Foreign Tourists</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We should be facilitating the foreign tourists in every way possible so that they could come to the country through <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>Cheap Flight Tickets</strong></a> in large numbers. Even though the incumbent government has abolished the condition of NOC for foreigners, much more needs to be done to boost their confidence in the government. Apart from maintaining their security, the government should also hire local people who can guide the foreigners on the complexities of the areas. Similarly, there should also be consistent efforts to accentuate the cultural beauty of the country for the foreigners.</p>

<h3>4.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Province Empowerment</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of handling all the tourism-related stuff on its own, the federal government should devolve the powers to the pertinent provinces. This aspect had become more crucial after the passage of the 18th amendment. The federal government should allocate the funds for the provinces and ask their officials to leave no stone unturned to facilitate the local as well as foreign tourists.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, it is the responsibility of provincial governments to pay special heed to the tourism infrastructure of their provinces. Not only will it sustain economic growth, but it will also lessen the trust deficit among the people.</p>

<h3>5.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Promoting The Public-Private Partnership</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The services of PPP (Public-Private Partnerships) can also be utilized to enhance the capacity of the tourism sector. With the phenomenon of PPP, it has become easier for the government to shift the load to the private sector. The government devises the policy framework and then asks the private owners to follow the prescribed procedures. For many years, the PPP framework has been immensely effective in <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/flight-promotion-deals"><strong>Airline Deals</strong></a> and hotel infrastructure. So, this potential can also be tapped in the tourism sector in order to create a sustainable tourism environment.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final Thoughts</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For Pakistan, earning the status of the “Best Tourism Destination” is a landmark achievement, but the real test lies in preserving that status. If the government is serious about making Pakistan the next big thing for tourism, it must implement the strategies outlined in this piece.</p>', N'ways-to-improve-tourism-framework-in-pakistan', N'Hamza Farooq', NULL, 697, 1, CAST(N'2020-01-16T15:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">The architecture of Pakistan is defined by multiplicity, and most of them are located in major cities that you can visit by taking flights from <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>air-travel companies in Pakistan</strong></a>. Contemporary designs, both following and departing from tradition, struggle with many stories. On account of the conjunction and juxtaposition of conditions, for example, controlled turn of events and informal settlements in Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad, contemporary plans are molded by more extensive settings.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In turn, these public and private projects explore new spaces and forms. While restaurants and eateries remain the main attraction, Pakistan has to offer to international and local audiences a list of some of the finest architecture in Pakistan.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mohatta Palace</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The blend of pink Jodhpur stone and yellow Gizri stone makes Mohatta Palace one of Karachi''s kind structures. Mohatt Palace is also one of the oldest buildings in the city. The stylish style of Indo-Pak recovery engineering was worked by Shivratan Chandraratan Mohatta, a Rajithani money manager in 1927.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the split, Quaid-e-Azam''s sister Fatima Jinnah moved here and, in 1995, was turned into a museum by the Sindh government.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Faisal Mosque</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When a design by Turkish architect Vedata Dalokaya was selected for the Faisal Mosque, many raised an eyebrow. The mosque is named after Faisal bin Abdul-Aziz, the Saudi king who suggested creating a national mosque in Pakistan and largely financed its construction.

	<div class="custTitle">


	    <p></p>


	</div>


</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Many of the world’s renowned and even small airlines have been providing their clients with most primary economy class rates for many years. Tragically, some of the airline companies have also started taking advantage of the latest trend of offering baseline fares for their business class flights. Qatar airline is last to get its position on such airlines’ list that introduced <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/qatar-airways-flights"><strong>Qatar Airways ticket</strong></a> basic fares for its business class flights. They do not include pre-seat selection and even lounge access to their business class travelers with this new release.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Fair Families</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Now the Qatar airline will offer six different types of fare families which are as followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Class now will offer Elite, Comfort, Classic.</li>
<li>Economy Class now will offer Comfort, Convenience, Classic.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The catch is that the aircraft isn''t simply re-branding existing toll classes, but instead is removing things. As confirmed by Executive Traveler, with these progressions Qatar Airways business class charges that book into the "R" passage class will not, at this point offer the accompanying as standard advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advance seat selection.</li>
<li>Lounge access.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new rates have just been stacked into the framework. At the point when you go to choose a business class admission, you''ll currently observe that in numerous business sectors the least expensive choice reflects advance seat selection. It will only be accessible at registration, just as lounge access is not being referenced.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fares Application</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you booked your Qatar Airways tickets preceding November 8, 2020, the guidelines at the time you got your reservation to apply. At the end of the day, recently reserved "R" class tickets are as yet qualified for seat assignment and lounge access.</p>

<p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">With that said</span>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>With this policy, it''s impossible to say if individual lounge guests will know that recently reserved tickets are qualified for lounge access or not.</li>
<li>New rules may be applied to you if you are going to reissue your tickets.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Qatar Airways has started selling separate business class fares in most markets, including flights to the Middle East from the United States. The initial strategies show that the new tariffs don''t seem cheaper than what you''d expect before. Instead, they''re missing some key services and amenities that were once free Qatar Airways'' Classic Business Class fares no longer include pre-seat selection or free lounge access.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It makes it the best chance to book affordable airline tickets because it will turn out to be a lot better deal as compared to business class. Fares still include regularly checked baggage allowance, free stopovers, earning miles, and can be changed or cancelled.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">However, depending on the program you grant for, you may earn fewer miles than other business class fares and pay a higher cancellation fee.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The “U” class remains unaffected by these policies and only the “R” class falls under the umbrella of new effect.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While you must view your booking on Qatar''s website to see the price, you can purchase access to the Al Mourjan Business Lounge. Unlike many basic economy products, which usually allow advance seat selection for a fee, this tariff does not seem to include any advance seat selection at all. This is especially bad news for groups who would like to reserve a "quad" in the Q-Suite cabin. One-world Sapphire members and Emerald will continue to receive free lounge access, regardless of the tickets they have, as part of their elite benefits. Albeit a Qatar lounge specifically for the One-world elite, not Al Salon Mourjan.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Important Points</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Qatar Airways has introduced new, liberated business class fares that no longer include lounge access and pre-allocation of seats. The good news is that One-world Sapphire and Emerald members can still select seats in advance and can use the lounges by their one-world privileges. We find this policy incredibly unforeseen. We predict that these changes will make business class will become much more popular, but Qatar Airways did the wrong thing. Because most people like to <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>book affordable airline tickets</strong></a>. The whole system doesn''t generate additional demand and would not force any sane person to buy for a higher price.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead, it might just get people to book another airline. No one will feel surprised at all if an airline backed off this policy or introduced a freed-up business class that makes sense at some point in the future.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">No matter how you slice it, it''s a sad change for one of the world''s best business class products, and it also seems to be a particularly strange time to make such a change.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Unbundled or non-standard business class fares are tragically becoming more and more famous as time goes by. Qatar Airways ticket fares aren''t lower than business class prices that the airlines used to offer in the past. So now people will have to pay a lot more for the extras that were previously included.</p>', N'qatar-airways-launches-new-business-class-fares', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 546, 1, CAST(N'2020-11-11T10:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<div style="text-align: justify;">
Mistakes are done at every time. Sometimes passengers do great blunders in case of booking <b><a href="https://www.faremakers.com/" target="_blank">Cheap Air Tickets</a> </b>. They become angry with online reservation systems. You might also have gone through this kind of experience. Well, I have specially gathered list of most important points which should be remembered before booking cheap flights.<br />
<br />
This list will be proven extremely helpful for you.<br />
<h3><b>Hurriedly Booking</b></h3>
Most important mistake which people do is doing booking in a hurry. They only tell their travelling dates and want to get tickets in an instantly. They do not see cheapest fare available. Most of us are doing not do analysis of ticket prices which is biggest mistake. Whenever you want to buy Air Tickets at most affordable cost, do not purchase speedily.&nbsp; You should remain calm and peaceful. Examine ticket rates very carefully and then buy.<br />
<h3><b>Need To Know</b></h3>
<b><a href="https://www.faremakers.com/flight-promotion-deals" target="_blank">Flight Deals</a></b> are specially announced for providing discounted prices to customers. If you do not use them then air ticket is charged at original price which is very high. Airline Promotions also include some kind of concealed benefits for you like getting transit hotel stay free of cost or buying one ticket and getting another completely free.<br />
<h3><b>Advance Booking In Wrong Matter</b></h3>
Many people also do not know about advance booking and they use it in wrong manner. Advance booking means that you should use more time duration like you should book ticket at least 1, 2, 3 or 4 months before travelling. This time period is excellent one for doing advance booking.<br />
<h3>
<b>Choosing Imprecise Travelling Agency</b></h3>
Most of the customers also choose wrong travelling agency which do not care about them. They only think of earning money from them. Today Pakistan''s first online travel company <b>Faremakers</b> provide the maximum customer care facilities. They only remain active 24/7 only for service of customers.<br />
<h3><b>The Best Sale Person</b></h3>
Choosing accurate sales person is also very important. Lot of passengers do not think about sales person they are contacting for buying tickets. Great salesman trust you and they also provide you with lowest flight options. They keep on guiding for advance ticket reservation and also solve your problems. This kind of business relationship is great because it helps us to save our money.<br />

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Since Covid-19 has hit the world, the tourism industry of the world has been adversely affected. However, in future, it may rise to new heights with the idea of <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>online flights booking</strong></a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Generally, Tourism industry focuses in the tourists, but there are other factors which have been affected.  Tourism industry comprises of three elements; revenue generator authorities, visitors, and people related to tourism (Hotel owners, guides, small sellers, Tour service providers etc).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following are some of the impacts of Covid-19 on the Tourism industry in 2020.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Less Revenue generation</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The major negative impact is the low rates of money generated from tourism. There is a huge decline in the rate of traveling tourists around the world. The travel agencies, tourist guides, hotels are not getting enough clients. That’s why; the authorities are unable to generate revenue for the betterment of the industry. So, the economy of the countries is being affected; authorities have not collected enough Sums to improve tourism after the closure of the pandemic. As a result, people who are associated with this tourism industry have lost their jobs or already have shifted to other fields, reducing the workforce of the industry.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Affected Tourists and Tourist Attractions</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These days, tourists have been asked to remain at their living spots only. Likewise, they are not allowed to travel and live their lives with full zeal. This has risen to the cranky behavior and poor tourist’s productivity. Covid-19 has affected the health of tourists. The visiting places either they are parks, museums, or outdoor areas, have become desolate. The beauty has been lost in the lost crowd. There are several chances that these spots would not be physically visited after the pandemic. The reason is, tourists have been more inclined towards electronic tourism.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Tourism has been banned in most of the countries. In fact, tourists have avoided traveling around the world. However, as soon that the pandemic is losing its stance, tourism is coming back to its form. Airlines are resuming their flights to support traveling. However, still, people are avoiding to get in touch with others. To help tourists, air companies have now focused upon the online booking system facilities such as <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/saudi-arabian-airline-flights"><strong>Saudi airlines online booking</strong></a> are preferred. Therefore, now tourists can book their tickets online and travel safely, following SOPs. So, if you are a tourist who has already got bored in the meanwhile, travel the world through online booking.</p>', N'impact-of-coronavirus-on-tourism-industry-2020', N'Aqsa Tayyaba', NULL, 338, 1, CAST(N'2020-07-29T11:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Founded on 29 October 1946, <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/pakistan-international-airlines-flights   "><strong>PIA - Pakistan International Airlines</strong></a> is the national flag carrier of Pakistan which operates in more than 16 countries across Asia, Europe, Middle East, and North America. In addition, PIA also serves 18 domestic and 25 international destinations with more than 35 aircraft in its fleet. The primary hub of the PIA is Jinnah International Airport Karachi; however, Allama Iqbal International Airport Lahore and Islamabad International Airport are also considered as the main hubs of the airline. The leading aircraft of PIA include ATR 42-500, Boeing 777-200ER, Boeing 777-200LR, and Boeing 777-300ER.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Convenience for the passengers is the hallmark of the Pakistan International Airlines. From accommodation and traveling advancements to the amenities of meals, PIA offers all the things that will undoubtedly make your journey luxurious. The baggage policy of PIA is the testimony to this argument. To facilitate the consumers, PIA charges a minuscule amount for any kind of baggage and paraphernalia. However, considering the revamp in the quality of the services, PIA has decided to increase the fees for additional baggage.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this piece, we have tried to inform the readers about the previous and new charges of PIA for additional baggage.  Read on to get an in-depth knowledge of the new PIA baggage policy.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Charges For Additional Luggage Before 24 Nov 2019</span>:</h3>

If you are traveling in Economy class, then you can carry the baggage of 7 kg max on both domestic and international flights.

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Charges After 24 Nov 2019</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On Nov 24, 2019, PIA-Pakistan International Airlines raised its fees for additional baggage. The spokesperson of PIA said that the commuters would now have to pay Rs5800 on additional luggage amounting to more than 10 kilograms on all the domestic and international flights. The raised charges for the additional luggage are as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rs5800 per 10 Kg for all domestic and international flights.</li>
<li>Rs250 per Kg for all the domestic flights.</li>
<li>Rs2500 per Kg from Karachi to Dubai bound flights.</li>
<li>Rs800 per kg from Karachi to Jeddah bound flights.</li>
<li>Rs 3500 per kg from Karachi to London bound flights.</li>
<li>Rs25000 per 27 Kg from Karachi to Toronto bound flights.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PIA officials have said that the decision to increase the charges has been taken in light of the taxes being imposed on the airline by foreign countries. However, the officials have clarified that once the taxes are withdrawn, the charges will revert to their original prices.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It would be tough for most of the people to sustain the hiked charges. Therefore, the sane approach would be to transfer as less luggage as possible while going to a foreign country. It would not only save your money but would also reduce the burden on your shoulders.

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“There Is No Power On Earth That Can Undo Pakistan” (Quaid’s words)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pakistan’s first online travel company sharing their happiness in advance with all the Pakistanis on the Independence Day.  Your traveling partner is true patriot and do love by heart to their land because if today, we work here as a free entrepreneur, live in our homes peacefully, go for earning respectfully &amp; safely, it’s all just because of that day which came in the past due to the efforts of “Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah” on 14 august 1947 (27 Ramadan).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Allah Gifted Us This Homeland On The Pious Month Ramadan”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On 14 august 2018 it celebrates in all over the Pakistan prominent location is Wagah Border. There will be national flag raising ceremony held and flag hoisting in the sky with the “National Anthem” as the proud of Pak Arz-e- zameen. Many people will go to this location for the respect of flag hoisting and for pay regards of Pakistan’s founder. In the early morning after hoisting flag, army soldiers do parade in the shade of flag.</p>

<h3><strong><u>Country’s Recognition:</u></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“The Foundation Of Our Land In On ‘Kalama Tayyaba’ Pious Ayat”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Flag is the symbol of a country, without flag you can’t recognize as a nation, so must respect your flags. Our flag consist of two portions with printed crescent moon and 5 rayed  star, 1 section is large with green color that is the symbol of Muslim’s majority while white section is small that show minority of other religious also has rights in Pakistan.  Our homeland is peaceful land in which follow all policies according to Islam, give rights equally to men &amp; women, even pay rights to the minority of other religious.</p>

<h3><strong><u>Background Reflection:</u></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now we tell you about few lines of sacrifices which do our ancestors for getting home-land. New generation don’t clearly know about how many difficulties faced our fore-father for this land in which we live peaceful with freedom.  Hindus treated very badly with Muslims, our elders do not offer even prayers in Mosques, and Muslim’s women do not go outside safely. They lived as a worst life on the earth, and then Allah Almighty sent his pious person in the named as Muhammad Ali Jinnah with his companions Allama Iqbal, Liaqat Ali Khan and other. When we discuss companions then we can’t neglect the name of Miss: Fatima Jinnah. Even she got the title of “Mader-e- Millat (mother of nation)”. She stood every-time with her brother and does effort, struggled as she done. She motivated the women about separate homeland. Her brother said:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“No Nation Can Rise To The Height Of Glory Unless Your Women Are Side By Side With You.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They came in the front as angels for Muslims and did effort to reliefs our fore-father from the British &amp; Hindus cruelty. In 1930 Allama Muhammad Iqbal gave the idea of a separate Muslim’s home-land that would geographically covered Muslim majority areas in the subcontinent. This lovely land named  coined by  Choudry Rehmat Ali that conjunction of two words Pak meaning Pure and Stan meaning Land, which means <strong>(Pak Sar Zameen</strong><em><strong>)</strong>. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With them political efforts our ancestors do lot of sacrifices, they came to Pakistan by dropped everything behind in India. Many Muslims killed in the way, many girls kidnapped, children killed in front of parents. Bloodbath is commonly played as a holy event. But finally Quaid-e- Azam succeeded to get Pakistan with their companions for the Muslims.  It’s all that sacrifices which can’t explain in the words. Just advise to all the new generations, respect our ancestor’s sacrifices and always try to remain peace in Pakistan because we got this land after many count-less self sacrifices.</p>

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">All the countries worldwide are planning new rules and regulations now and then and trying to minimize the spread of COVID-19. The same is the case with Canada, which has the latest guidance and laws that all the travels will have to follow. Regardless of your carrier and flight type, you will need to follow these instructions if you want to travel to or from Canada. Whether you''re taking <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/pakistan-international-airlines-flights"><strong>PIA online flights</strong></a> or with any carrier you must read the following instructions very carefully to make sure that your travel goes without any unwanted situation. So, let''s dive into it.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How Canada''s New Instructions are Going to Affect You</span>?</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Canadian government has issued a new travel advisory that will be applied on 22nd February 2021. The government announced that all the travels to Canada would have to provide a COVID-19 molecular test. Yes, the test criteria have now been updated, and you will have to undergo a molecular test if you want to exit the airport and enter the country. However, some expectations and people with unique and specific conditions won''t have to fulfil this requirement. Moreover, the travellers will also have to remain in 14 days of quarantine period as well, and this also has some exceptions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the government has also announced that the travellers taking any flights from Canada will have to stay for three days and three nights in the designated and authorized hotels when the test will be accepted. Moreover, they will also have to bear the hotel''s cost while they will wait for their COVID-19 molecular test results.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hotel Booking Information</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The hotel booking information is not yet available, and it will be provided on 18th February 2021. The travellers will have to book a hotel in the same city where they first arrived in Canada. If they receive the negative COVID-19 molecular test results, then they will have to take connecting flights to where they want to go. The government will provide several hotels names which the travellers can choose, and the hotels will also be near to the four main international Canadian airports which are in the following cities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Montreal</li>
<li>Vancouver</li>
<li>Toronto</li>
<li>Calgary</li>
</ul>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Information</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The price that the travellers will have to pay will include the room food cleaning infection prevention and control measures and security and transportation. The travellers will also have to provide their contact and travel information such as a suitable quarantine plan, electronically through ArriveCan before boarding the flights or crossing the border. All the travellers taking flights to Canada from Pakistan will continue providing their COVID-19 related information electronically daily in their quarantine period.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the travellers will also have to avoid contacting other people whom they did not travel with. This is everything you need to know about the latest travel advisory by Canada. We hope that it will help you to take the PIA flights to Canada or any other accordingly.

	</div>



	<div class="custTitle">


	    <p></p>


	</div>


</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Japan is one of the most industrialized nations. The rich culture of the country dates back thousands of years. Indeed, long before many of the spectacular western churches were built, Japan already had some of the most prestigious buildings. From the serene bamboo forests and dazzling skyscrapers to the enthralling temples, Japan is like nowhere else on the planet. The people here are polite, food is incredible, and the country has one of the most sophisticated public transport systems in the world.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the country has a plethora of enchanting places, a visit here through <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>Cheap Flight Tickets</strong></a> is a must in your lifetime. However, like many other countries, Japan also has some regulations and norms that must be followed by foreigners. You must learn how to behave on certain occasions and how to respect Japanese culture. Today, we are going to discuss some vital things that you must need to learn in order to make the best out of your stay in Japan. Let’s start.</p>

<h3>1.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Japan Has No Street Names</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the arrival of GPS and smartphones, finding addresses was the real challenge in Japan. For example, you could not have known where an officer lived or on which street a famous restaurant was located. It is because there are no street names in Japan. Even though some major thoroughfares do have a name, but it is not enough to precisely locate a place. It means that finding a place in Japan is really tricky. However, if you have GPS on your mobile, then you can easily check the addresses.</p>

<h3>2.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Japan Has Four Seasons</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is of utmost importance to check the weather forecast before packing for Japan. Since the country has four different seasons, it is possible that Japan is beating the heat while you are shivering with cold in your country. Plus, it is also entirely possible that one place in Japan is hot, while the other one is getting cold at the same time. The high altitude areas are relatively chilly, whereas central Japan remains stable.</p>

</p>

<h3>3.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cash Is Everywhere</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Like many other countries, the Japanese are still struggling with the dilemma of cash. So, instead of sending the payments on the bank account, the owners pay their employees in cash. Similarly, most of the hotels and shopping malls also do not accept the ATM or debit card, and the only option you have is to pay them in cash. So, never forget to bring a lot of money in cash before entering the country. However, if you are without cash, you can head to 7-Eleven, where you can conveniently use ATM.</p>

<h3>4.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Never Tip In Japan</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is vital. After entering the country through <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/turkish-airlines-flights"><strong>Turkish Airlines Booking</strong></a>, never tip under any circumstances. Tipping in Japan is considered a sign of arrogance and rudeness. The waiters might think that you are pretending to be a rich person and that you are trying to subjugate them. No matter how delicious the food or how vigilant the management is, never show your gratitude with money. You can just make an X sign with your fingers to show your appreciation.</p>

<h3>5.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taking Off Your Shoes In The Restaurants</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have finalized where you will eat, never forget to enter the hotel or restaurant without taking off your shoes. It is widely known that the Japanese don’t wear shoes in their homes, and this can also apply to restaurants and at some public places too. As soon as you enter the hotel, the waiter will point out where you can store your shoes. Some shops even provide the customers with slippers so that they can conveniently go to the washroom.</p>

<h3>6.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Smoking Is Not Allowed Everywhere</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Like in many countries of Asia, smoking in public places is completely forbidden. However, there are some designated smoking areas near the big shopping malls and buildings where you can go and smoke freely. Smoking in public areas is deemed disrespectful and derogatory. If a cop finds you while you are smoking, then he can impose heavy fines on you. The offense is so risky that it might land you behind bars.

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Traveling with the kids can be the most fascinating experience, but if not managed properly, it can be a complete disaster. When we travel alone, we do whatever we want, but once we become parents, it becomes crucial to make a few changes in our otherwise crazy behavior. From long packing lists and eccentric kids to the uncertain schedules and unavoidable circumstances, everything might get challenging along the way.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">However, some useful tips can save you from going insane while you are traveling with your kids after acquiring <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>Cheap Air Tickets</strong></a>. It is your right to travel with your kids as often as you can, and no obstruction should be coming in your way. To help you manage the coherent trip planning, we have come up with 8 tips. You will fully enjoy your family trip if you strictly adhere to these smart ideas.</p>

<h3>1.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pack Wisely</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Packing for a long family vacation is not a walk in the park. Apart from managing your own gear, you are also supposed to handle everything your children need for the trip. Your children would certainly not survive without the necessary items, including blankets, bedtime books, electronic toys, and delicious noodles. Some important things you can pack are socks, rain jackets, cold weather gear, sun hat, and shoes, etc.</p>

<h3>2.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bring A Stroller</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the kids are not steady walkers, and you will inevitably need a stroller to manage their jet lag. You might have to walk for miles during the tour, and kids can''t endure such an arduous journey. A light stroller would help you to take your kid from one place to another conveniently. The stroller can also act as a temporary bed, given that you can insulate it with blankets and rain covers.</p>

<h3>3.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bring Snacks</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Your kids might not like the meals of the plane, and it is a good idea to bring snacks they are accustomed to and that do not break the custom laws. The kids are less likely to vomit if they are familiar with the snacks. Because finding your child sick during the flight would be the most disturbing feeling. Once you are inside the airport, you can buy some fruit cups that are adored by all the children.</p>

<h3>4.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Book Hotel Near The Road</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Staying at a place that is near to the central town or road will save you from walking too far. It will also help the teenagers to play safely and explore the town by themselves. Similarly, the main roads usually contain various shops from which you can easily buy anything. Booking your hotel away from the central road will isolate you, and your children would have a hard time enjoying the precious moments.</p>

<h3>5.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Always Travel With First-Aid Kit</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Your kids can get sick at any time while traveling. They might start having headaches, or some of them might catch flu due to the changing weather patterns. To combat this challenge, always bring a first-aid kit while you travel. Plus, also get thorough know-how of the nearest hospital to your traveling destination. The first-aid kit can also be acquired through <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/flight-promotion-deals"><strong>Airline Flight Deals</strong></a> that are offered for the convenience of passengers.</p>

<h3>6.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Utilize Technology</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though you do not want your children to watch the TV at home, you have to break this rule during the trip. Turning on the screens of your mobile will not only grab their attention, but it would also prove to be a source of entertainment. Your children will perceive this as some sort of gift, and they would feel immensely happy after watching a movie or cartoon.</p>

<h3>7.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tackle The Time Zone Difference</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are going to another country, then the time zone will certainly affect your children’s sleeping patterns. Various studies tell us that the younger the child, the harder it is for him to overcome jet lag. Some children can even take a week to adjust to the different time zone. So, you must manage the routine of your children in such a way that they could adapt to the new time zone.</p>

<h3>8.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Let Your Kids Play</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the kids are single-minded, and the only thing they want is to play! So, you must give them enough time and space to have fun. The best way to do this is to look for hotels with a pool and garden. Go to the nearby restaurants once in a while and ask your children to enjoy at the play lands. You should also stop at playgrounds and play various games with your children. Your kids will never forget this experience, and an eternal image of hospitality will be imprinted on their young minds.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final Thoughts</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">During the tour, it is also vital to break your routine to make life a bit easier. Your family is the most valuable thing for you, and you need to give every second of your life to your family to embrace the new experiences. Wait no further, and book the cheap flights for your family from <strong>faremakers.com</strong>, Pakistan’s leading travel channel.</p>', N'8-critical-tips-for-traveling-with-kids', N'Hamza Farooq', NULL, 744, 1, CAST(N'2020-01-08T15:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">You will get excellent news if you are restricted from booking PIA flights to the UAE and work there. PIA is planning to place mobile testing lab facilities.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You must already know that the UAE is one of those places in the whole world where the number of ex-pats is very high. The majority of them are from Pakistan who <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/pakistan-international-airlines-flights"><strong>books PIA flights</strong></a> to reach there. But because of the COVID-19 and less available testing facilities, many of them cannot get to the UAE. That’s why PIA has planning to place mobile or portable testing labs at the airports to facilitate as many travellers as possible. So, whether you want to book Lahore to Dubai flights or from any other city to the UAE, it’s excellent news for you.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Portable Testing Labs</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With numerous Pakistani ex-pats unable to book PIA online flights to the UAE since the Rapid Test facility is unavailable at airports, PIA in Pakistan has stated that it would soon put up mobile test facilities.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Carrier will establish up mobile laboratories on airports to enable UAE-bound passengers to do quick testing before flying. This news is shared by Shahid Mughal, who is Pakistan International Airlines'' regional manager.</p>

<p>
<strong>Must Read:</strong> <a style="color:Purple;" href="https://blog.faremakers.com/Blog/2021/8/5/pia-plans-to-operate-special-flights-on-ashura-to-iraq"><strong>PIA Special Flights To Iraq</strong></a>
</p>

The PIA holds international flights to the UAE from the following cities of the country:

<ul>
<li>Peshawar</li>
<li>Lahore</li>
<li>Islamabad</li>
<li>Sialkot</li>
<li>Multan</li>
<li>Karachi</li>
</ul>

You’ll need to this plan if you book Dubai flights from Lahore or any other city.

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Situation Before this Plan</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In former years, Pakistani stranded people searching for a UAE flight with PIA were refused from airports because of the absence of fast airport tests. "All Pakistani airports have no rapid antigen test facilities. Passengers cannot board flights thus. The United Arab Emirates has emphasized that it is carefully following SOPs (standard operating procedures) and bringing passengers to comply with all rules and requirements."</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On Thursday, the UAE has permitted fully immunized Pakistani residents and other banned nations to return. However, a rapid test facility in the premises of the departing country airport is necessary for people booking Lahore to Dubai online flights.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A challenge for all the airlines</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">All airlines face this problem, as this facility is not provided at any of Pakistan''s airports. Importantly, this rapid test must be carried out both within and outside the premises of the airport. This implies the speedy trial is to be carried out four hours before flights to the UAE in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dubai</li>
<li>Abu Dhabi</li>
<li>Sharjah</li>
</ul>

from the following cities:

<ul>
<li>Islamabad</li>
<li>Peshawar</li>
<li>Lahore</li>
<li>Multan</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It means that if you book <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/flights/cheap-flights-from-lahore-to-dubai"><strong>Lahore to Dubai flight tickets</strong></a>, then you’ll have this facility. Some labs in Pakistan provide fast testing facilities. However, this is pointless, as the test does not take place at airports. It’s important to note that you should not make reservations and spend funds on PCRs or other tests unless it is evident that they have recently accounted for fast test airport facilities.</p>', N'pia-plans-to-place-portable-testing-labs-at-airports', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 438, 1, CAST(N'2021-08-09T06:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

Passengers may be demanded to have another PCR test on arrival. Any symptom must be followed by complete isolation. Dubai authorities would not compromise on medical grounds.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Passengers are required to sign undertaking forms</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, All passengers need to give a declaration form of health to the staff of Dubai airport. The form should be duly signed and filled. Even the passengers of the connecting flights and who have destinations other than Dubai are still under the same rule. However, people who want to stay permanently in Dubai must fill up the Quarantine form at their arrival. Both forms would be checked by the staff members during check-ins. Contact the airport staff and Dubai health authorities for more updates.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from medical forms, all travelers need to download the Dubai Health application to remain updated and checked.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">British Airways is a good airline carrier that offers cheap flights and great services. But sometimes even the best airlines face difficult times, and in this article, we will discuss the same incident. You will find more information in this article about this news and read on to find that out.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, a British Airways flight took a staggering 36 hours to arrive at its destination. The airline attempted to land in Hong Kong two times but failed. So it had to go for an unplanned landing in Manila before reaching its final destination.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Harsh Weather Conditions</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On Saturday (9th October 2021) evening, a British Airways flight (Boeing 777-336ER) took off from London Heathrow for a flight that should have taken about eleven hours to reach its destination because it was a nonstop flight.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, a tropical storm had different ideas for people on board this long-distance service. It was approaching from the South China Sea, prompting Hong Kong officials to issue the third-highest warning yesterday. As a result, transportation systems, workplaces, and schools have been forced to close.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The aircraft crew attempted twice to land the airline flight in Hong Kong but aborted at about 1,500. After failing to land, the crew opted to fly to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport of Manila.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Passengers Spend a Night on the Ground</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While landing the British Airways flight, another location was inconvenient in and of itself; there were additional worries since people on board were unable to disembark due to tight quarantine restrictions imposed by the epidemic. As a result, passengers and staff members spent the night sleeping in the cabin. The plane again took off from Manila the next morning, landing in Hong Kong around midday after two more attempts.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Comments of the Crew</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">British Airways was contacted by many reporters and new channels for comment on this airline flight. The airline''s representative stated the following.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our aircraft, like many others, was diverted to another location (Manila)because of the Tropical Storm, which is named Lionrock. But the airline has landed in Hong Kong successfully. The flight crew was concerned for the passengers on board the plane, and the airline started its apologies for the difficulty.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final Words</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Time-consuming trips are not uncommon. To save money, travellers frequently pick multi-stop itineraries that take more than a day to accomplish. They are also frequently the sole way to travel to a specific location. Those travelling on the same British Airways flight this weekend, on the other hand, would have been irritated that they were so near to their final destination but had to land in some other place and they also had to spend a complete night on the plane.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the difficulties, the crew could safely transport their passengers to Hong Kong and should be praised for their efforts.</p>', N'a-british-airways-flight-to-hong-kong-took-36-hours', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 237, 1, CAST(N'2021-10-14T07:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Many places are opening as they have somewhat recovered from COVID-19. It doesn’t necessarily mean that they have recovered from the global pandemic completely but they are doing so to run their economies better. The same is the case with Abu Dhabi which is now open to tourists. Now you can take <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/etihad-airways-flights"><strong>Etihad airways flights</strong></a> to reach Abu Dhabi whenever you want and you won’t be needing the COVID-19 test. But wait, this offer might not be applied to you as there is a whole list of the countries that can avail of this offer. Keep on reading this article to find out if you fall on this side or the other side.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The News</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Dhabi reopened to tourism on December 24 and allows all eligible countries for visas upon arrival to visit, with a green list of 16 countries eligible that can have air travel for entry into the quarantine free zone. At a time with nearly every country announcing new flight closures, restrictions, and cancellations, Abu Dhabi''s reopening is positive news in an otherwise gloomy travel environment, even if entry requirements are a bit complex.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What Do Authorities Say</span>?</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the authorities, the government and health authorities of Abu Dhabi have implemented the highest possible safety standards, and its guidelines remain stringent and effective, allowing us to accept international travelers without endangering public health. Their new Go Safe certificate is a confirmation from health and safety inspectors that the following fully meet safety standards.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hotels.</li>
<li>Cultural facilities.</li>
<li>Entertainment facilities.</li>
<li>Shopping centers.</li>
<li>Other hotel and tourist facilities.</li>
<li>Only this way the tourists will be allowed to return with confidence.</li>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The List of the Green Countries</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Countries considered "safe" have been placed on the Abu Dhabi Department of Health "green" list and will renew every two weeks. Any traveler from a country on the green list will not have to meet the quarantine requirements and will only be subject to the testing requirements. Currently, the green list of countries that can take Etihad airways flights to visit Abu Dhabi under the offerings mentioned above includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vietnam.</li>
<li>Uzbekistan.</li>
<li>Thailand.</li>
<li>Tajikistan.</li>
<li>Taiwan.</li>
<li>Singapore.</li>
<li>Saudi Arabia.</li>
<li>New Zealand.</li>
<li>Mauritius.</li>
<li>Malaysia.</li>
<li>Hong Kong.</li>
<li>Greenland.</li>
<li>Greece.</li>
<li>China.</li>
<li>Brunei.</li>
<li>Australia.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Greece is Also on the Green List</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is suspected that Greece''s green listing in Abu Dhabi is due to reciprocity and not to the epidemiological status of the country, which has a much higher number of cases than other countries on the list. Greece was the only European country to allow visitors to opt for <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>air travel</strong></a> from the United Arab Emirates where the UAE appears to be reaching out to Greece in reciprocity for re-opening Abu Dhabi. The majority of the nation’s not on the green rundown can in any case head out to Abu Dhabi as long as they fit the bill for a visa on appearance and consent to meet the 10-day isolate prerequisite.</p>

<center><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Testing Requirements</span>:</h2></center>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Test Upon Arrival</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon arrival, all passengers will also receive a COVID-19 PCR test. Even if you are traveling from a country on the green list, you need to isolate until test results are available, usually 12-24 hours.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before Flight</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To board your flight to Abu Dhabi, all passengers must complete a PCR test no later than 96 hours before departure and provide proof of negative results.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Test on Eighth Day for Quarantine Countries</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Travelers who arrive from countries NOT on the green list and who are required to undergo 10-day quarantine must perform a PCR test on the eighth day of their trip to be released from quarantine on day 10 and have a wristband removed.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Test on Sixth Day and Twelfth Day for Green Countries</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Travelers who come from the green countries and are therefore released from the 10days quarantine must also undergo a PCR test on the Sixth and Twelfth day of travel.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grand Canyon, USA</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">500ft deep and 277-mile long, Gran Canyon National Park is located in the plains of Arizona, America. It is considered as the most spectacular landscape of America given its giant rocks. The complete geological history of our planet has been inscribed on these cliffs. Studying the rocks will give you the scenic view of the ocean, mountains, and sky. Each year, more than five million visitors come to Grand Canyon National park, but only a few make it to the canyon floor.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Giza Pyramid</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The great pyramid of Giza has undeniable importance considering that it is the oldest manmade structure on the planet. Archaeologists believe that the Giza Pyramid was built in 20 years and completed around 2560 BC. The Giza Pyramid has amazed modern engineers and architectures as they wonder how it was constructed in times when the infrastructural facilities did not exist.

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Petra, Jordan</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Petra Jordan has an incredible archaeological value that allure thousands of tourists each year.

As per the Smithsonian magazine, you should definitely see Petra before you die. Fly Dubai can conveniently take you from your local city to the Jordan where Petra is situated.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blombos Cave, South Africa</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Blombos cave is located 200 miles east of Cape Town and flaunts the oldest human drawings. The cross marks written in the walls of the cave are believed to be 73000 years old. The illustrations depict the start of human creativity and symbolic thinking. The caves also prove that humans landed on earth thousands of years ago. Going to South Africa through Fly Dubai airline ticket booking will be exceptionally inexpensive for you.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Great Wall Of China</span>:</h3>

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">If you like to travel by booking British Airways flights, then there is good news for you. Your favorite airline is launching a low-cost carrier.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">British Airways is one of the most popular airlines globally, and many people prefer British Airways flights over other airlines. Although nothing is yet finalized, the British Airways management published a memo that explains the new plan of the company to launch a new low-cost airline. Continue reading to find out if you like to test new airline carriers with cheap flights working under British airways.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">British Airways Announcement</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Gatwick has not operated short-haul British Airways flights throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, as you are aware. In the past, the airline industry was fiercely competitive, but the company needs a competitive operating model to survive in the present climate. A new operational subsidiary would run alongside our existing long-haul Gatwick business and would serve short-haul flights in or out of Gatwick starting in the summer of 2022. These improvements will allow British Airlines to be more flexible and competitive and eventually establish a long-term short-haul presence at Gatwick.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Current Situation of the British Airline with Gatwick Airport</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, British Airways has attempted to determine what to do with Gatwick Airport. Both Heathrow and Gatwick airports have slot restrictions, with Heathrow slots being more expensive and difficult to get.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With demand at an all-time low, British Airways has appropriately centralized operations at Heathrow to be more efficient. During the COVID-19 pandemic, British Airways ran a raw schedule for Gatwick. The carrier flew select long-haul British Airways flights but eliminated its short-haul network. While the restrictions for using slots have been loosened, for the time being, they will be reinstated eventually, and it is unknown when British Airways will return to pre-coronavirus passenger levels.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The New Plan of British Airline</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The latest idea from British Airways appears to be to continue offering mainline long-haul <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/british-airways-flights"><strong>British Airways online tickets</strong></a> from Gatwick. However, while the airline acknowledges the need for short-haul traffic, it does not believe its present cost structure is competitive. From the passenger experience perspective, it doesn''t offer much cheaper flights than what British Airways provides.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bottom Line</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">British Airways is developing a carrier located at Gatwick Airport that will offer cheap British Airways flights. The idea is that this will allow British Airways to continue operating long-haul flights from Gatwick while also providing short-haul services with a lower-cost business model. British Airways has undergone a significant transformation over the last decade to reduce costs. However, I''m guessing British Airways is seeking further labor concessions here. This would be the third low-cost carrier for International Airlines Group. It is exciting to watch how this plays out because many experts doubt British Airways'' labor unions will trust the corporation at this point.</p>', N'british-airways-flight-plans-to-launch-a-low-cost-carrier', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 246, 1, CAST(N'2021-08-27T12:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">If you plan to travel to London or any other place with <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/british-airways-flights"><strong>British Airways Cheap Flights</strong></a>, then there is great news for you. The airline plans to launch a new offering for its travellers in conjunction with Qured (it is pronounced as cured), a government-approved partner. It will make it easier for you to travel with this airline because you won’t need to go to any third-party testing facility to get your COVID-19 test done.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How it’s Going to Affect You</span>?</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">British Airways aims to make the whole process easier for its passengers to get their COVID-19 test results before returning to the UK.
The United Kingdom government has issued the instruction since January 2021 for all travellers to bring COVID-19 negative test results, which are to be taken not earlier than 71 hours of their flight. However, it was a little difficult and tricky to accept the test from some of the foreign countries. The airline has begun the program where the travellers will undergo the COVID-19 test from the airline itself at affordable prices to make the whole process seamless and easier.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Solution</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This program had already begun yesterday (4th of March 2021), and now you can avail this self-test facility before your departure. If you are planning to air travel with British Airways, then you can get your COVID-19 test done at only 33 pounds before going abroad, and you’ll need to take the test results with you all the time. You can also conduct it yourself while travelling back to the UK as this test is issued as self-administered.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Details of this Self-Administered Test</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Covid-19 test that British Airways has started fulfils the guidelines that the government of the country has issued. You can be in any place on the planet to conduct this test because you need to make sure that you keep the testing kit with yourself all the time. Moreover, you will also need to have a stable internet connection to perform the test.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, you will need to deliver the COVID-19 tests only to the UK; however, some other countries can also accept it on some defined and particular routes which are departing from the United Kingdom. Other than that, you are also still required to pay for the eight and two-day COVID-19 PCR tests, which are already taking place mandated by the United Kingdom government.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How Does this New COVID-19 Test Work</span>?</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These COVID-19 tests under the self-program that the airline has just started are but lateral flow devices. The working mechanism of these devices is pretty much the same as pregnancy devices. It would help if you ran a swap (in addition to up each of your nostrils) on both sides of the back of your throat.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, a trained and highly qualified member of the Qured organization working with British Airways will observe your while you’re performing this test via video call to make sure that the process has been done correctly. The sample you will get through this process will be then mixed in the liquid before placing a couple of drops on your test kit. At this point, your video call will be ended, and you’ll need to wait for about 20 minutes before the results come up. Then you will need to take a picture of the results along with your ID and send it to the Qured organization. Their team will then process your test results and verify them, and you will be granted a certificate that will confirm your test results.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You will also need to use the VeriFLY service that British Airways has issued to upload your test results before you go for your <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>Air Travel</strong></a>. Moreover, the airline is currently working with both of the organizations (Qured and VeriFLY) to join both of the services to make the whole process automatic.</p>

The brewed milky concoctions would certainly put water into your mouth. Paratha is a crispy fried flatbread that can be found at various stalls in the city. People in Karachi believe that after eating this item, a person forgets all sorts of worries and miseries. The chai also has so many versions including karak chai and doodhpatti. Everyone has their own preference, and Lahoris will definitely cherish the original flavors.</p>

<h3>2.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoid Getting On Buses</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The buses of Karachi are notorious for congestion and poor quality. Though traveling through buses is quite cheap, you wouldn’t like the atmosphere and the jam-packed interior. In addition, they are also full of thieves and pickpockets who do no spare anyone. If they realize that someone has come from Lahore, they always try to deceive them as they think that Lahoris are quite well-off. However, there are some destinations where you cannot go without embarking on a bus. So, always be vigilant and careful of the professional thugs who will try to grab your attention through flattery.</p>

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">There are more than 1.8 adherents of Islam in this world, and mosques are primary places of worship for all of them. The word mosque is derived from the Arabic word “Masjid,” meaning a place of worship. With crowning domes, glowing marble, and the stunning architecture, mosques appear extraordinarily stunning from outside. They depict the Islamic-style of architecture with pristine prayer halls and Persian carpets.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Mosques are not only the places of worship for Muslims, but they also serve as educational centers where children are imparted with the Islamic teachings. Even though most of the mosques are limited to Muslim worshippers, some also allow modestly-dressed non-Muslims for tour. Here, we are going to list 5 most amazing mosques from all over the world which will compel even the non-believers to raise their hands for prayer.</p>

<h3>1.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Al-Haram Mosque, Mecca</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Haram Mosque is not only the largest and oldest mosque in the world but also the holiest site in Islam. Whenever Muslims pray, they turn their faces towards the Kaaba, a cubed building at the center of the mosque and the most sacred spot in Islam. The mosque covers an area of 400,800 square meters and can accommodate up to four million people. During Hajj, millions of people assemble here and perform the annual pilgrimage. The mosque was originally built by the Prophet Ibrahim (AS), and since then, it has been modified several times. The Holy Quran terms this mosque as the first house built for humanity’s worship of Allah.</p>

The mosque has historical and architectural importance as it boasts the six needle-like minarets and ancient beauty. It also has five major and eight minor domes that skyrocket its captivation.

Every Muslim believes that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was transported from Al-Haram Mosque to this mosque and then onto heaven during the Night Journey. The mosque is a stunning structure that has been reconstructed several times due to being repeatedly hit by the earthquakes. The interior of the mosque is supported by 45 columns, 12 of which are stone and 33 of white marble.

Thousands of bulbs light up the magnificent chandelier of the mosque that took more than 4 years to complete. It is so impressive that even the Emiratis and Qataris came here and copied the design just to create the same chandelier for the mosques in their own countries. Amazingly, the uniquely designed carpet of the mosque is termed as the second-largest hand-woven carpet in the world.</p>

<h3>5.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Faisal Mosque, Islamabad</span>:</h3>

The clean lines and the impressive design of the mosque make the stunning scale hard to recognize until you are up close.

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">China Southern Airlines offers one of the <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>Cheapest Flights</strong></a> as well, along with its luxury ones. Now it’s planning for five Airbus aircraft to get ready for international travel.

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re planning to travel to China with China Southern Airlines or any other, then there is good news for you. The mentioned airline, just like any other, was greatly affected by the COVID-19. But as the world travels in on the brings of resumption, it’s taking all the necessary and important steps to make sure that it is perfectly ready for travelling. If you want to know more about this news, keep on reading to find out this article. So, without any further ado, let’s jump into it.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The News</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">China Southern airlines are considering its five airbus aircraft, A380s, for future international travelling. Although the plan is not specific and nobody just yet knows when the international travel will resume, the airline is making sure that everything will be in place to book flights they need when it happens. The senior vice president of the airline Mr. Guoxiang Wu said about the airline, a Guangzhou-based carrier, that it’s still under consideration and review of how the airline will solve this current issue of airbuses. He also said that it is not very easy to determine whether the operation case compared to the routes of these airlines is very high.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Airlines</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Other than China Southern Airlines, many other airlines also stated the same dilemma. We also noted that the future of the super big aircraft is still uncertain because people still can’t take the cheapest flights or any other ones for international travel. That’s because it is still sitting on the fence, and the forecast for international travel says that it can still take years to go back to the regular flight routines that we used to have before the pandemics. He added that the airline is also retiring some of the old aircraft to manage the current issue.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">From the perspective of the airline, the international travelling network still experienced many problems for the future. That’s why the carriers can''t remodel and rethink their whole business structure. We, although, are getting signals that we will need Airbuses in the future for the international travel in the coming year, so we must make sure the right and promising future of the fleet primarily for the big birds.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">China Southern Airlines Performance</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The vice president also stated that the airline''s performance remained more potent than the rest of the domestic airlines during COVID-19. Now the analysts and business experts suggest that <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/china-southern-airlines-flights"><strong>China Southern Airlines</strong></a> are undoubtedly going a lot better than the rest of the airline carriers in China in that specific regard.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s undoubtedly just a matter of time that international travel comes back to life as it used to be, and all the expenses of the airlines will add up because of the abundance of travellers.</p>', N'china-southern-airlines-future-planning-of-its-five-airbus-a380s', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 362, 1, CAST(N'2021-04-21T12:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">From the hills of northern Europe and arctic Russia to the islands of Indonesia and Thailand, coronavirus is taking a toll everywhere. Ever since the emergence of this deadly virus, all the countries have been strictly warning their citizens not to travel to and from China through <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>Cheap Flight Tickets</strong></a>. Similarly, people who are returning from China have been subject to strict medical care in a bid to avert the spread of the virus. More than 10,000 cases of the virus have been registered, and as per the Chinese officials, about 259 people have died until today.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The novel coronavirus has also severely affected the tourism-dependent economies as travel enthusiasts are afraid that they might catch the disease if they encounter some Chinese tourists. Likewise, several flights have been suspended owning to the extremely sensitive nature of the virus that has the potential to permeate in anyone. In today’s piece, we will analyze the catastrophic repercussions of this lethal virus for traveling and how it has caused ripples in the world.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus Has Been Declared A Global Health Emergency</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday declared the novel coronavirus a global health emergency, thereby surging the fears of the travelers. The chief of WHO said that the primary reason for declaring the virus a global health emergency was not China, but rather the other countries which were likely to be affected. The organization also expressed its fears that the virus could quickly spread to the countries with weaker health management systems.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When a disease is declared a global health emergency, it means that it is the responsibility of the entire world to tackle the issue and leave no stone unturned to save precious lives.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Travel Advisory By Different Countries.</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Several countries have warned their citizens not to travel to China. America is the latest country to have given a highest-level warning to its citizens. The US State Department has said that due to the outbreak of coronavirus, it is highly likely that the US citizens traveling to China could catch the virus. America has also suspended the flights in a bid to thwart the spread of virus.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the US, other countries have also given a warning to their citizens that if they travel to China, they would face the deadliest consequences. Meanwhile, China is also urging the people of other countries to halt their plans and keep staying in their home countries.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus And The Airlines</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The virus has wreaked unprecedented havoc on the air industry. Most of the countries have suspended all China flights. The most prominent countries to have suspended the flights are USA, UK, Pakistan, New Zealand, Singapore, Vietnam, Africa, and Egypt. It is estimated that the flights to and from China would not operate until the end of April. However, the officials of <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/turkish-airlines-flights"><strong>Turkish Airlines</strong></a> are saying that the operations of flights may be reactivated earlier if the virus is curtailed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The suspension in the flights is proving catastrophic for the revenues of airlines. The airline companies are worried that if the current situation persists, they would have no option but to fire the employees because they would have no money to pay for their salaries.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bangkok Tourism Sector Hits 7-Month Low</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Thailand''s biggest source of foreign tourists is China. Each year, millions of Chinese travel to the tourist destinations of Thailand, thereby boosting the Thai economy. However, the Tourism Authority of Thailand has estimated that this year that the number of Chinese coming to the country would be much less. The official currency of Thailand is Baht, which has lost half of 2019’s gains in just the month of January due to the flu-like virus that has the potential to devastate the tourism sector of the country. The Baht might further deteriorate if current gloomy situations continue in the months ahead.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Effects On Russian Tourism</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Kola Peninsula is a Russian territory famous for its breathtaking natural scenery. However, the hotel and restaurant owners of this area are concerned about the repercussions of the virus on the Chinese tourist arrivals. The Kola Peninsula is a place where Chinese tourists arrive in groups and not like individual travelers. The ban on the organized groups will significantly drop the earnings of operators.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the previous months, hundreds of thousands of Chinese had visited the area to enjoy their holidays lavishly. However, the outbreak has drastically reduced these numbers.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The spread of the coronavirus can only be curtailed through proper awareness and advisory campaigns. The more preventive measures we take, the better it would be for all of us.

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Here how you can get your COVID-19 test if you’re planning to travel to the United Kingdom with <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>cheap airlines</strong></a> or any other, and your plane will land at Manchester Airport.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s expected that in the next month, May 2021, the international holidays will return from the United Kingdom, and it will cause a spike in the COVID-19 testing (which is related to travel). If you’re planning to book your flights from Lahore to Manchester, you must know about the information discussed below.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manchester Airport Demand</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bosses from the Manchester airport have suggested that there should be a fourth travel category in the light traffic scheme of president Boris Johnson. It will notify that the passengers under this light won’t need to go through any COVID-19 test. It will make it easier for international travellers who are already have taken their vaccination shot. Moreover, there are also strict rules that the government has placed for the COVID-19 testing.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where Can You Get Vaccinated At Manchester Airport</span>?</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The authorities have made Terminal One the reception for the testing, which is a train station terminal. Bear in mind that you will need to walk for a couple of minutes to reach the testing facility located at Terminal One. Here at this Meet and Greet office, you’ll get what you need if you’re booking your flights from <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/flights/cheap-flights-from-lahore-to-manchester"><strong>Lahore to Manchester</strong></a>.
Moreover, it is important to bear in mind that it’s completely a separate facility and it remains open seven days a week from 7 am to 7 pm.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How Does the Testing Work</span>?</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">First, you will need to book your test, and for instance, if your test is due at 4 pm on Tuesday and you are due to get the results on Thursday at 4 pm, then the time on your results certificate will be mentioned as 4 pm Tuesday.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So, you need to ensure you meet the objective country prerequisites for timing, for instance, if the test should be inside 72 hours of movement. The most regularly mentioned test is the PCR. This can be a swab test or a spit test. The spit test takes around three minutes. The swab test will take around three minutes, and an individual from staff will take an example from you with either a double nasal swab or a swab from the nose and throat.</p>

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Short for polymerise chain response, these tests straight forwardly distinguish the presence of the infection instead of an immune reaction or antibodies. They can identify if the sickness is available from the beginning before the individual is indicative or irresistible. They take longer since they are completed in machines that need to spin through various temperatures. If you’re going to book your flights with cheap airlines or luxury ones, you will need to go for your COVID-19 vaccination at the Manchester airport. That’s why it’s important to know how it works.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What if your test results are positive</span>?</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If your test results are positive, then a registered and designated nurse will lead you to a private room where s/he will discuss your results with you. You will get your initial advice from there as well, explaining how to take care of yourself. Moreover, you will not take your flight because you will need to quarantine for ten days. There will also be no need to inform the airline about your condition because the airport staff will take care of it.</p>', N'guide-to-get-covid-19-test-for-travel-at-manchester-airport', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 573, 1, CAST(N'2021-04-27T10:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

With extensive parks and a pleasant climate that maintains mild temperatures all year round, Vancouver is a paradise for outdoor enthusiasts.

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Museum of Anthropology</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It''s easy to be dazzled by Vancouver''s geographic splendor, but to get to know the city well, you need to start all over again. Vancouver and what is known as the Lower Mainland was populated about 10,000 years ago. Overlooking the Burrard Inlet, on the campus of the University of British Columbia, the Museum of Anthropology offers a mosaic of Aboriginal works, both ancient and modern, that make up a story rarely told to visitors to this great city. If you really want to learn about the city''s roots and its relationship with the global community, this is one of the most important things you can do in Vancouver.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capilano Suspension Bridge</span>:</h3>

It is where the locals hang out with their friends or take a dip in the outdoor heated seawater pool. The wide beach is popular with sunbathers in summer. The views from Kitsilano to the city center are stunning.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the beach and the ocean, there are many cafes and walking routes in the area, and a lively shopping street lies a few blocks south of West Fourth Avenue.

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Main Purpose Of Introducing The Service</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Generally, most of the internet users do not have online accounts through which they could pay the money from their homes. When they select the most appropriate flight, they are unable to book it because they do not have online payment resources. So, when they come to the branch, their desired flight is already booked by someone. As a result, they have to start the entire process from scratch.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Benefits Of This Service</span>:</h3>

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the coronavirus pandemic, hundreds of Pakistanis are stranded in different countries. They are unable to reach home because of the suspension of flights. So, in a bid to alleviate the worries of stranded citizens, the officials in Pakistan have finally decided to resume the special flights to bring back the citizens. The flights will be resumed from 11th of May, and would continue to operate until all the passengers are escorted to Pakistan.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Details By The Special Assistant To Prime Minister</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On May 11, Special Assistant to PM on National Security Division Moeed Yusuf briefed media on the possible steps that the government would take. In the briefing, he asked the stuck overseas Pakistanis to carefully follow the guidelines being mentioned in the official COVID-19 Website.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Talking about the number, the Special Assistant said that so far, 20,000 Pakistan had been successfully returned. He also clarified that there were still about 100,000 Pakistanis that needed to be repatriated. The government is planning to bring back around 10,000 people in the upcoming week through <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/pakistan-international-airlines-flights"><strong>PIA Flights</strong></a>. Most of the Pakistani citizens are stuck in the Gulf States, so the government will focus primarily on these countries.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flights From UK, USA And Africa</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, since the government of USA has allowed Pakistan to operate the special flights, the Pakistani citizens in United Stated would also be brought back. Moeed Yousaf added that Pakistan would also operate flights to Britain, UK, and some African countries. At the end of his briefing, he emphasized the need for everyone to take strict precautionary measures. He said that all the repatriated citizens would be first sent to the quarantine centers where they would be properly checked. Consequently, the citizens would be allowed to return home after spending 14 days in the centers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Definitely, it is clear that this country is blessed with the diversity and we also accept that the manners, social ideas, culture, rituals, rules & regulations might be distinct from own country, but it does not refers that you will not plan a trip to China. In fact, you should plan to China in your coming holidays schedule and it is amazing that many travelers also reserve the flights to the China, for those we are going to share with all of you the ten major points, you should avoid in China, while examine this strong economy country.</p>

<h3>1.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoid Showing Affection</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When you are visiting the China country and talking with the Chinese, then you should avoid the handshake because the majority of the Chinese dislike this type of practice and same like the Kiss and the hug is also not normal. So, when you meet with any local or the citizen of this country, just pay smile and Nod is the best way to meet them, but not show physical affection in the China state. Therefore, we are telling you the first about this because many people have the concept that the overseas are broad minded and prefer to hug to the meeting, while it’s not applicable in the China.</p>

<h3>2.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoid Talking About Politically Subjects</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, the best avoiding point is to stay away from any politically subject because it is very sensitive point. If you want to stay away from any type of trouble, then you don’t talk about any politically subject, especially around the airport, bus station or around the police or the security members. In fact, you have no need to talk with their local tour guides of the China or avoid criticizing in public places because they people have the pride of the country and can’t bear the controversy about the China. Therefore, you should avoid these types of criticisms about anything in this country because it makes you in trouble and spoil your trip.</p>

<h3>3.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoid Wearing Shoes In Shrines</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.faremakers.com/china-southern-airlines-flights"><strong>China Southern Airlines Tickets</strong></a> make you able to land at the China country and you start your journey from this international airport. Next morning, when you start your journey, then you might be visiting any temple, shrine or the religious place. You should avoid entering into that place with the shoes because the Chinese have the strong faith according the religious places and they don’t bear that any other one disrespect their temples. So, you should take off your shoes out of the entrance, and then you can enter into the temple and show respect.</p>

<h3>4.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoid Tipping</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As we know, china is the hospitable and friendly state; they like to help others without any tip. So, if the citizens or the locals help you or the serve you, then don’t pay tip in the form of thank you because it is considered the rude and ill manners. Therefore, always say Thank you and you can give them gifts, but the best avoid is tip against any service. The simple and the easiest way are verbal Thanks to the locals, instead of any tipping.</p>

Might be possible after using the services you show them the card, they fall into the confusion situation, to get free from this situation, you should use the money and must be avoided using the card.</p>

<h3>6.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoid To Use Unlicensed Transport</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When you step out from the airport, you will see a lot of drivers, who persuade the passengers or the customer to hire them a taxi to approach the city or the pointed location, but you should avoid them because many of them have no valid china driving license that fall in trouble. Therefore, it is recommended that, always try to travel in the local; public transport that offers the pick and drop to the specific fix stops or use that taxis which have the legal c companies. So, just avoid the private unlicensed taxis and prefer to travel on the public transport because it is affordable and trust able.</p>

<h3>7.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoid To Get Angry</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When you are going to buy the souvenir or anything about shop, then you must avoid getting anger because the anger at the public lace in very uncomfortable inconvenience for the Chinese and they don’t deal with the angry person.

Therefore, you should avoid visiting any attraction place at the public holiday.</p>

<h3>9.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoid Leaving Chopstick In Food</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Many of us are unaware about the table manners and the chopstick manner because only Chinese are using it very carefully and it is their cutlery, but this point is more important that you should avoid, while eating with the Chinese or restaurant. You never leave your chopsticks upright in your food because it is considered as the bad luck or it seems like a funeral ceremony tradition that the locals use to pray the death one person. So, you must avoid this chopstick in the food.</p>

<h3>10.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoid Taking Picture Without Permission</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Might be it sounds basic, but it is most important and carefully step that you should follow in the china.

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re planning to book flights to London, then there is excellent news. British Airways is coming back to business with a dramatic increase in the number of flights.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are restricted to book British Airways flights because of Covid-19, then the great news is that you might not need to face the same issue any more. Like any other airline globally, British Airways had to restrict its flights to all over the world because of the global pandemic. Not only did it cause a problem for the airline, but it also affected the travellers a great deal because they couldn’t fly to their desired destination. Now the tables are turning because of the vaccination. Now more and more people will be able to book flights to London if they are vaccinated.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">British Airways and Surge in Flights</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">British Airways is getting back to a business considering air travel, and now more and more people will be able to book online flights to London and other parts of the world with this airline. According to the latest news from the officials, the airline has experienced a staggering 96 per cent increase in the searching of flights with British Airways by travellers. The officials say that most of these online British Airways flight searching can translate into accurate booking.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The officials say that it is the highest volume that the airline has experienced this year, and it is planning to convert it to actual travel by offering more British Airways flights.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What to Know Before Traveling with British Airways</span>?</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The COVID-19 epidemic has changed much on British Airways and the overall international airline industry. The British flag carrier has in store for us in the coming months regarding British Airline flight booking from a new catering offering to health passports.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, it is very probable that travellers will have to hold COVID-19 travel certificates while <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/flights/cheap-flights-from-lahore-to-london"><strong>booking online flights to London</strong></a> or any other city. This includes the required testing of vaccine status before flying to the United Kingdom. Similar to the airport visa screening process, all may be verified by a staff member before travelling.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">But British Airways has made several efforts to shorten airport wait times and confuse the people booking online British Airways flights. Those flying to the United Kingdom may utilize the VeriFLY application before they even leave home to obtain digital documents verification.</p>

T<p style="text-align: justify;">he COVID-19 also allowed British Airways to revise its offer of onboard catering offerings. The buy-on-board shorter-haul menu was first halted, and the water bottle and a complimentary snack took their place. The water bottle rule will remain the same in the coming months whether you book Lahore to London flights with British Airways or any other site.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final Words</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to British Airways officials, it travels to green and amber locations more than any other United Kingdom airline. This corresponds to a total of 43 different places where people can book <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/british-airways-flights"><strong>British Airways flight tickets</strong></a>.</p>', N'british-airways-planning-to-increase-the-air-travel-for-vaccinated-travelers', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 600, 1, CAST(N'2021-07-12T10:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you can go for a <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>flight booking</strong></a> to Australia as New Zealand plans to open a quarantine-free travel corridor with Australia.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We all know that because of the COIVD-19 even the closest countries had to close their borders. The same happened between New Zealand and Australia. But now New Zealand has planned to open quarantine-free air travel with Australia. Now you can easily go for the flight booking from Australia to New Zealand knowing that there will be no hassle. It will start taking effect from 18th April 2021. It was announced by Jacinda Ardern the Prime Minister of the country.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why this News Matters</span>?</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris Robert from the New Zealand tourism industry and officials from other authorities have said that this decision can serve the country as a model for other nations. Robert added that it will provide a model blueprint for international trade and travel. It’s important to keep in mind that both of the mentioned countries have been trying to take this step from the last year.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Effects of the Decision</span>?</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This bubble of quarantine-free air travel will change the landscape of the economic recovery of both countries. It will help other countries as well that to safely open, air travel with their neighbouring counties by making sure that the virus is not spreading. Moreover, we hope that it will also lead the way for our country and people will be checking <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/flights/cheap-flights-from-lahore-to-melbourne"><strong>Lahore to Melbourne ticket prices</strong></a> soon for their travel to Australia.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Scott Morrison who is the Prime Minister of Australia said that this decision means that there will be more aircraft in the air. Not only will it improve tourism and trade but it will also create more job opportunities on the ground as well. He also added that it’s only the first step and both of the countries are planning to take more ones in the near future to get back to the normal air travel that once used to be before the global pandemic.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How will it Work</span>?</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Prime Minister of New Zealand said that the government implemented a complete framework to keep the virus from spreading. She said that they had to follow a strategy that involved three different scenarios which are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Continue</li>
<li>Pause</li>
<li>Suspend</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The health minister of New Zealand said that the country is implementing an infrastructure that will make sure that the passengers coming from Australia have their own green zone on the airports. This zone will not have any other traveler except people with the flight booking from Australia to make sure that the virus doesn’t spread.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the critics and experts say that this bubble can help New Zealand by bringing more than one billion dollars to the economy. Other than that, it will also improve the tourism that has been dying for the last one and a half years. It is undoubtedly a piece of great news for the people who want to travel between Australia and New Zealand and this step will also encourage other countries to do the same.</p>', N'new-zealand-and-australia-to-start-quarantine-free-travel', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 257, 1, CAST(N'2021-04-14T11:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reopening Activities</span>!</h3>

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">On Friday, February 29, PIA, the national flag carrier of Pakistan, clarified that its flight operations to Saudi Arabia have not been suspended and that all the flights are continued as per schedule. It has been said by <strong>Pakistan International Airline</strong> that the flight operations to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would not stop until the return of all the Umrah Pilgrims to Pakistan.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The development came after the Saudi Authorities took preventive measures against the deadly coronavirus that has taken a heavy toll on several countries. As per the official directive, Saudi Arabia had imposed a temporary ban on the passengers from the countries affected by the lethal virus, including Pakistan.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Intention Behind Saudi Arabia’s Move</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the deadly virus is highly contagious, the authorities of various countries are trying their level best to keep the people of the affected countries at bay. In the beginning, it was only China where the cases were being reported; but now, the virus has reached several other countries. Some countries, including Iran, have even reported the deaths of their citizens owning to their inability to counter the virus.</p>

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So, keeping the safety of their citizens in view, the Saudi officials declared that the Mecca and Medina would not receive pilgrims. Their decision reflects how serious the Saudi Authorities are regarding the coronavirus that has already taken over 2,800 lives in China.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Concerns Regarding The Temporary Ban</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Several Muslim countries have expressed disapproval regarding the temporary ban on their citizens to Mecca and Medina. Indonesia, the world’s biggest Muslim-majority country, has urged Saudi Arabia to allow its citizens to continue their Umrah Pilgrimage. Each year, over 1 million pilgrimages visit the kingdom to perform Hajj and Umrah. The state officials are saying that at the time of the announcement, there were thousands of citizens staying in Mecca and Medina. The immediacy of the decision will undoubtedly impact the citizens of all the countries whose pilgrims are in the kingdom.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement Of PIA Spokesperson</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The spokesperson of <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/pakistan-international-airlines-flights"><strong>PIA</strong></a> said that due to the instructions of Saudi Authorities, the tourist visa holders and the Umrah pilgrims would not be able to travel to the holy lands temporarily. He further stated that full money would be returned to the pilgrims.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">He further clarified that the people who hold permanent resident cards and the work permits are allowed to fly to the holy cities. Furthermore, the passengers are also being informed through the phone calls regarding the decision of Saudi government.</p>', N'pia-flights-to-saudi-arabia-have-not-been-suspended', N'Hamza Farooq', NULL, 1304, 1, CAST(N'2020-02-29T12:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">No other country in the world is so misunderstood as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and it''s worth a visit by taking <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/saudi-arabian-airline-flights"><strong>Saudi Arabian airline flights</strong></a>. No other country that is so diverse and rich in culture, heritage and natural beauty is worth visiting.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a country with many areas of beautiful oases and dramatic mountain peaks and beaches. This article provides a brief introduction to various aspects of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">History</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Day of Saudi Arabia commemorates the establishment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by King Abdul-Aziz. The visionary king tirelessly fought to unite his country after decades of riots and uncertainty from warring tribes and competing interests. King Abdul-Aziz, head of the Al-Saudi family, finally managed to unite the country under the name Saudi Arabia on September 23, 1930, and every year since then, this day is a great celebration.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Citizens come together to honor traditional customs, honor the nation, and pay tribute to those who helped build the country, including the ruling Al-Saud family.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foundation</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Qur''an is the foundation of Saudi Arabia''s society faith, government, education, and law. The Koran teaches many educational values, including "observing the earth and heaven" by studying the natural sciences such as biology and Tirmidhi, getting to know angels, and praying for the welfare of people who seek knowledge.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">People often value the word Quran in school textbooks, but there is controversy over whether schools should teach it. Most of the more than 700 non-profit charities accept donations to make the Koran a subject of research.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Climate</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">June to August more than 110 degrees Fahrenheit noon in the desert; humidity in coastal regions up to 100 percent; elsewhere, mild; possible winter temperatures in the northern and central regions fall below zero; rainfall, from zero for up to 10 years in Rub Al-Khali, to 20 inches per year in the mountains of Asia Province.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are from Pakistan, you will not have any trouble to getting used to the Saudi climate, and you can take Islamabad to Jeddah flight to reach this amazing country.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Online Schooling</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Colleges such as the Dean''s Office and Distance Learning Department at King Abdul-Aziz University in Jeddah provide flexibility in student schedules, allowing them to study at their local library or home. Citizens are striving to get more online learning opportunities in Saudi Arabia today, hoping that in Saudi Arabia elsewhere, we will soon accredit online learning.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Essayists, for example, Hend Suliman Al-Khalifa, writer of the e-Learn Magazine report, advance online colleges, for example, Arab Open University.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Language</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Saudi Arabs speak Arabic, which is the official language of the Kingdom, but tourists who do not know any Arabic should not feel intimidated. Many Arabs speak English, or at least enough English to facilitate communication. Most of the road signs are written in Arabic and English, enabling foreigners to move around the area. English-speaking visitors are likely to do well in Saudi Arabia, not knowing any Arabic phrases, but knowing a few keywords and phrases can score many locals'' points.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It''s advisable to learn a few phrases in the Arabic language before taking Saudi Arabian airline flights.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Weekends</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Saudi Arabia, Sunday is the first day of the working week, so weekends are celebrated on Friday and Saturday. Friday is considered a family day throughout the Kingdom, and many families spend the day praying in mosques and at activities. For this reason, many shops and restaurants are closed most of the day on Friday. Some venues will open at 2pm, but others will wait until 4pm, before unlocking the door. Restaurants are the exception to this rule. Some of the restaurants offer lunch meals.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Travelers who will be in the Kingdom over the weekend should plan to accommodate longer queues and heavy traffic. If you want to have a memorable weekend, then consider taking <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>Islamabad to Jeddah</strong></a> flights if you are from Pakistan for a couple of unforgettable days.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Currency</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The national currency of Saudi Arabia is the Saudi Riyal (SAR). Guests can exchange local currencies at the airports upon arrival, and it is best to bring dollars or Euros for the exchange as some national currencies are not accepted.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Riyals come in 500, 100, 50, 10, and 5 banknotes. Coins are issued in denominations of 1 rial and 2 riyals, and riyals are divided into halala. ATMs are available at all airports and shopping centers.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Getting There</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In total Saudi Arabia offer 28 different airports in which 15 are domestic and 13 are international. It’s comparatively a very big number that demonstrate that you won''t have to worry about traveling locally or internationally while being in the KSA. If you’re from Pakistan specially from major cities then you can book your flights to KSA from any renowned airline agency.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you arrive at KSA, it''s easy to navigate from city to city whether it big or small by taking services of car-sharing companies or local bus and taxi services. Other than that the railway system of Saudi Arabia only connects famous regions such as Riyadh and other famous places in eastern province.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These are some of the most important facts you have to keep in mind while traveling to Saudi Arabia. Whenever you take Saudi Arabian airline flights, keeping these facts will help you move around with more confidence.</p>', N'8-interesting-facts-about-saudi-arabia-with-saudi-arabian-airline-flights', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 625, 1, CAST(N'2020-10-12T10:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">As we all know that all the airline organizations in the world are striving hard to come up with solutions to increase their travelers. Some of them are offering discounts with their <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>online ticket booking</strong></a> and some of them are offering incredible and sometimes even ridiculous promotions and deals. At the same time in the heat of the moment, some of the airlines are rather coming forth with some unique solutions. Today we are going to discuss the same example where Kuwait Airline has acquired its very first airbus A330-800s from Airbus company.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Many of the critics and experts predict that this bold step has the potential to turn the tables for the discussed airline.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The News</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Airbus company delivered its very first A330-800s, and both of these giants are handed over to the Middle East airline carrier Kuwait Airways. Now the company will offer even better Kuwait airline flight deals. Additionally, the -800 is the smaller of the two members of the A330neo lineup.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Kuwait Airways requested eight Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 twin jets in late 2018 as a feature of an arrangement that cut the A350-900 request. Around then, it was the main client of the variation. Airbus has since gotten general requests for 14.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Kuwait Airways president Ali Mohammad Al-Dukhan says the introduction of the A330-800 will sure strengthen the airline''s position as the leading industry in both the local and international aviation sectors. He added that the arrival of the A330neos marks a new stage in the services we provide to our passengers on board, in addition to efficient and comfortable air transport.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kuwait Airways Flight Deals</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Kuwaiti flag carrier used its latest planes on fairly routine flights back and forth between Kuwait and Dubai. A simple jump over the Persian Gulf, the distance between the two cities is only 530 miles or 853 kilometres. It looks like this service was delayed by about 50 minutes. Upon departure, the plane landed just over an hour before arriving at Dubai International Airport, given the hourly time difference. The plane then spent a short hour and twenty minutes in Dubai.</p>

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The return journey, took a slightly longer flight time by an hour and 26 minutes. The more extended flight can principally be ascribed to the direction of the runways and the additional time it takes to pivot and get into the right position.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What the Airline has and will Achieve</span>?</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While the milestone is very important for Kuwait Airways. Additionally. it is arguably even more valuable for Airbus, which on Thursday also released relatively disastrous financial data (January through September)for the nine months. During this period, the manufacturer lost a huge amount of money. However, focusing on the A330 helps paint a picture of one of the company''s most popular aircraft types.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While the airline sold hundreds of older A330 variants, the company was hoping to bring this variant to the market to compete. That’s why upgrading it to be much more economical and comfortable for passengers. Below are the two of these new variants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airbus A330-900.</li>
<li>Airbus A330-800.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These behemoths represent a completely different level of success. While more than 300 A330-900s were ordered by dozens of different customers, Airbus only sold 14 smaller but longer-range A330-800s. While many people are skeptical about the decision by both the airline and the airbus company, others are hoping for good things for the airline. It’s just a matter of time till we find out how will it serve the carrier as well as travelers. You can get your online ticket booking for these airbuses but keep in mind that these will only be working for certain destinations for a little time.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final Word</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Kuwait Airways is the first airline in the whole of the world to get the delivery of the beast of the airplanes A330-800neo. Uganda Airlines will receive its first A330-800neo within the weeks yet to come. Then we''ll see what happens there and how it turns out to be for the company and also for the passengers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s still yet to be determined if the customers will take <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/kuwait-airways-flights"><strong>Kuwait airways flight deals</strong></a> against these planes. Less than 5 percent of A330neo orders were for the A330-800neo, while the A330-900neo is in demand.</p>', N'kuwait-airways-now-operating-worlds-first-passenger-a330-800-flights', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 451, 1, CAST(N'2020-11-24T09:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

<strong>2.</strong>	Over packing is not good, don’t carry useless or excess stuff with you while traveling.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3.</strong>	The unawareness about the prohibited and restricted items on a plane, fall the passengers in the un-pleasant situation. That’s why we always advise the passenger, must know regarding the flights and related information.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4.</strong>	The tourists ask the direction from the local citizens and trust on them blindly, but it’s not enough. You must ask more than one person about the same direction.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.</strong>	Totally grip on Guide Books or helping material is not the authentic meaning of comfortably.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6.</strong>	The majority of the foreigner Forget their budget limits and running out dozens of money.</p>

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>7.</strong>	The travelers who don’t maintain the backup of pictures and scenic views they face disappointment when lost or stolen a camera or virus destroy the software.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8.</strong>	The connecting flights booking with a short transit time is becoming the cause of the missing flights. So, avoid it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>9.</strong>	During traveling, not bringing documents copies is completely careless habit. You should put your important documents copy in your hand bag.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>10.</strong>	The visitors do not inform the banks for future international city transaction, then their credit cards immediately blocked due to the other state transaction.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>11.</strong>	The currency exchange process from the airport is resulting very expensive. So, try to exchange from the city centers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>12.</strong>	The majority left valuable things such as a DSLR camera, laptop, and expensive gadgets in the hotels or accommodation place becomes the cause of the stolen. Therefore, carry them with and hidden in a locked pack.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>13.</strong>	Tourists just ignore the norms and the Culture of the exploring destination, then the heavy fine charge on them. Just try to understand the surroundings in which you are staying. For example: if you are exploring the Pakistan country through the <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/serene-air-flights"><strong>Serene Air Online Booking</strong></a>, then you should be careful about their norms and values because this is the Islamic state and it does not allow you the affection in the public place.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>14.</strong>	Outsiders having all the money in a single place, but should avoid this phenomena because money should place in the various places in your different bags are quite safer as from the having all same place.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>15.</strong>	We see those travelers, who don’t bother too much research about the targeting destination. When they approach there, then they have to face something un-expecting. Involving, cold weather, sudden raining, etc and then, they have no proper equipment to save themselves at the spot. So, must research about the destinations before approaching.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>16.</strong>	Due to the lack of research, passenger is unable to reserve accommodation at the decent place. Proper research is the guarantee of the meet with the luxurious hotels or residential places with the facilities.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>17.</strong>	It is the biggest expensive mistake to eat near a major tourist site. Always try to eat at the local places because near the touristic sites the prices are too much higher.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>18.</strong>	And sometime holidaymakers prefer eating the food that you’re used in their country, but it might not be fresh at this destination because it’s not the cuisine of new destination. So, try to follow the prix fixe option of new destination.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>19.</strong>	The newly travelers just skip travel insurance and don’t give importance. But as a real traveler, you should make sure the travel insurance.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>20.</strong>	The few of the explorer prefer the private cab, but we suggest you, always prefer to travel in the public metro or transport. It is quite safe and more knowledge full.</p>

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>21.</strong>	Don’t engage with the locals is not the good behave. The talking with the locals gives you the opportunity to share the views and thoughts or provide you knowledge about the different culture and rituals. So, try to talk with the local citizens to create friendly relation.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>22.</strong>	Not taking a power bank on traveling is the biggest drawback. If you carry it with you, then you have never faced battery low issues in the mobile.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>23.</strong>	The trippers try to explore bundles of attraction sites, or planning too much in the single trip. It’s not possible, in this manner, you are un-able even to a see single place with satisfactory.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>24.</strong>	Sticking or relay to explore the city on the tour bus is not the efficient option. So, try to collect itself experiences.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>25.</strong>	Traveling in the touristic season or the high season is not bad, but you see the crowd anywhere, you have to spare place even to take pictures without hurdles, all the sightseeing has long queue & the hustle and bustle. Try to go off season to meet the exact and proper the taste of the destination.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>26.</strong>	Globetrotter not Spending Plenty of Time Outside places, while how much to spend the outside from the accommodation, you will get that much useful stuff and information.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Troy: The City Of Homeric Legend</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The site of Troy is engulfed in myth, and now several settlements have been built here. These sites date from the ancient Bronze Ages and the Graeco-Roman period. These sites rose to the peak during the Bronze Age owning to the conquest of Dardanelles. The historians term Troy the country’s most significant ancient site though walking through its craggy paths is complicated and underwhelming. If you really want to make sense of the site, never forget to visit the new Troy Museum, which built only to showcase the ruins and artifacts of an ancient civilization.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Perge: The Gem Of Coastal City</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The remains of small city confederations scatter the Mediterranean coastline of Turkey. These confederations are Lydia, Pisidia, and Lycia. It was the Iron Age that gave prominence to these confederations. As per the lore, Perge was founded by the refugees who were escaping the Trojan War. Their escape gave birth to the ascent of this city. The vast and overwhelming ruins include the monuments of nymphs, commanding Hellenistic gates, and various bath complexes. To capture the mesmerizing sweep of the street, you can climb up to the acropolis.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Patara: A City Of Classical Age</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lots of Mediterranean city-states were flooded into the Persian empires that vouched for control over Anatolia. However, the fierce independence movement of Lycia gave the locals some sort of autonomy. Patara is basically a confederation of 23 cities that are still self-governed. This region is believed to have the longest stretch of the beach. It is also the place where the ancient ruins of the Lycian city are scattered throughout the sand. The stretch of the ruins is 1.5 km long, and so, it is extremely convenient to reach here from Kas or Kalkan.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gobekli Tepe: A Temple</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to observe the earliest cultural beginnings of Turkye, head straight to the Gobekli Temples. This site has enigmatic pillars, decorated with carved foxes and vultures. These pillars were raised when humans were still hunter-gatherers. Currently, it is not only the UNESCO World Heritage Site but is recognized as the earliest site of worship in the world.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The discovery of this temple solidified the claims that religion is the driving force behind the agriculture invention. It is only 11km northeast of the Sanhurfa Archaeology Museum. Visiting these places will tell you how the ancient warriors used to live in their abodes.

	</div>


</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone wants to book a flight with cheap airfare regardless of the destination. That''s because travelling by air doesn''t usually come cheap. If you are looking for the best ways to book <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/pakistan-international-airlines-flights"><strong>PIA flight tickets from Pakistan</strong></a>, then you have come to the right place. This is not only because you will find the best and most useful ways, but it will also allow you to learn the practices that you can keep following to go a long way in your pursuit of finding the best air tickets. So, without any further ado, let''s dive into it.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use Online Flight Searching Portals</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The first and by far the most obvious way is to use online flight portals to find the best PIA flight booking options. Depending upon your country, you can choose an online search engine for both reputable and reliable flights. There are many online portals available that offer flight search engines, such as Faremakers.com. It would help if you went to such portals because they offer the latest and the cheapest flight information. Choosing a reputable agency might cost you a little more, but it ensures you stay away from all unwanted situations. Moreover, they also have excellent customer care service to acquire any time you want to get the latest information about your flights.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flight Comparison</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The second tip that we are about to unfold will allow you to choose only the best available option. You must not stay confined to only one type of flight. In fact, you must consider other flight options and online portals to compare your flight rates. It''s not necessarily true that one online portal or carrier always offers the cheapest airfare. There are always fluctuations, and you can find better rates in different places from time to time. You can find information about cross-airline flights as well. This way you will have enough information to make an informed and well-thought decision to find the best available flights.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Set Up Price Alerts</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It''s one of the best ways to stay connected to the upcoming and existing flight rates. You don''t want to search manually every time you need a PIA flight booking. You can use any third-party services that provide airfare alerts by application and offer free SMS services that you can get whenever a new fare arrives in the market. For example, if you plan to book your flights from Lahore to Dubai and get that fare, that will cost you 25 thousand Pakistani rupees. If there is still time left in your travel date, we recommend you wait and set up price alerts. You may get better rates in the next few days.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Join Travel Groups on Social Media</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">No one can deny the power of social media and how it has changed every business''s landscape. To stay connected with the flight information to get cheap airfares, you should join social media travel groups. Airline agencies and companies regularly put their new rates and promotions to get if you know about them. You can also turn the notifications on for those groups to ensure that you don''t even miss a single new update. This way you will get the most suitable and best flights that you always want.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consider Airports Which are Nearby</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It would help if you did not fly from the airports which are far away. That''s because it can create many complications. It''s quite possible that you won''t be able to reach the airport at your scheduled time and miss the flight altogether. Moreover, travelling to some faraway from the airport will cost you a lot of fuel as well. You might also not have the required information and familiarity with that area that can also cause problems. On the other hand, if you take flights that will fly from the airport exactly in the same city as you are, then all of these problems will be suddenly eliminated. You won''t even have to worry about the road travel you''ll need before taking the flight.</p>
 
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Keep in Mind that Cheapest is not Always Right</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It''s good to try to find <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>affordable airline flights</strong></a>, but you have to make sure that you don''t get carried away with it too far. Because cheap airline flights are not always the right option. That''s because some cheap airline flights come with a catch, a hidden cost that you were never aware of. Moreover, it might also not provide the same comfort level that you require, and the fatigue of the journey won''t allow you to have fun while you are finally at your destination. You can also have bat customer support with the cheapest airline flights. So, you have to make sure that the airline you choose is reputable and reliable so that you have the comfort of the journey you need.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Check out Policies</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">One important thing that most people forget is to check the policies and terms and conditions of your flights. Moreover, you also have to perform your research on the carrier that you choose. And you have to do it even before deciding to finalize your flights. That''s because you might find some of the information that you don''t live, some strict rules or maybe something that you cannot stand. Even if that''s the case where you don''t find anything conflicting, you still should perform your research. It will help you in all those conditions that you otherwise don''t know how to manage. For example, if an airline only offers 10 kg for hand carry bad and you didn''t know about it and packed 30 kg, you will have to face an unwanted situation. But if you perform your research, you won''t have to experience any such issues.</p>', N'how-you-can-easily-buy-pia-flights-tickets-from-pakistan', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 489, 1, CAST(N'2021-02-18T10:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">The aviation authority of Saudi Arabia has allowed the <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/pakistan-international-airlines-flights"><strong>PIA Pakistan International Airlines</strong></a> to operate special flight in order to bring the stranded Pakistanis back in the country. Since hundreds of Pakistanis are stuck in Mecca and Medina due to the suspension of flights, it is extremely crucial to bring them back. It is believed that the Saudi Authorities have permitted the PIA to pick the passengers from the kingdom on the personal efforts of the Air Marshal Arshad Malik, the incumbent CEO of PIA.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier, Saudi Arabia had imposed a ban on all the flights operating to and from the kingdom as the coronavirus was spreading like wildfire. It asked its residents living in other countries to return to the kingdom in 72 hours. Similarly, it also ordered all the foreigners living in the kingdom to vacate the country in 72 hours, i.e. till 14 March, because no flights would operate after 72-hour time period.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Goodwill Gesture By Saudi Arabia</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">However, it now seems that Saudi Arabia has shown some flexibility as it has allowed PIA to run special flights for stranded Pakistanis in the kingdom till 18 March. The CEO of PIA Air Marshal Arshad Malik had personally asked the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) to permit PIA for resuming the flight operations as hundreds of Pakistani citizens were stranded there. Here, it is worth noting that this generosity has been extended only for Pakistan and the flights of all the other countries can still not operate to Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the permission, the empty planes of PIA will land at Medina and Jeddah Airports. Subsequently, these flights will repatriate the stranded Umrah pilgrims to Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad. It is also believed that the PIA flights will also bring back over 1,800 Pakistani nationals from the kingdom.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Remarks Of Passengers</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Previously, the national flag carrier of Pakistan had operated about 22 flights to transport more than 6,000 nationals after the announcement of the 72-hour deadline. Similarly, on March 13, the stranded Pakistani pilgrims asked the government to assist them in the repatriation as they were stuck in Saudi Arabia amid coronavirus fears. The pilgrims also told the media that neither they had money to buy the tickets of other airlines nor they could afford to pay the rent of the hotels. They also lamented that despite the announcement of 72-hour deadline, the government made no special arrangements for the stranded nationals.</p>', N'saudi-arabia-permits-pia-to-bring-back-umrah-pilgrims', N'Hamza Farooq', NULL, 872, 1, CAST(N'2020-03-16T11:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Al-Balad, the memorable part of Jeddah, ace drafters as of late administered a careful rebuilding measure pointed toward safeguarding the charming structures for people in the future. Naseef House, presently a gallery and social focus, is a brilliant illustration of the building style.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The façades are described by huge rawashin, inlet windows, encased with many-sided wooden latticework called mashrabiya to advance wind current and faint the sun''s beams, keeping spaces generally cool.</p>

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Areas of the Jeddah Wall and its seven doors, each built at an alternate point ever, encompass the city. Inside the divider''s limits, Old Jeddah was partitioned into various locales that exist right up ''til today and are named for important functions or their separate areas.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Balad likewise includes a few antiquated mosques inside its dividers, including the Al-Shafi''i Mosque and Uthman container Affan Mosque, the most seasoned mosques in the old city.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Go to Fakieh Aquarium</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Found just on the Corniche, it''s extremely simple to stroll to the aquarium and go through a few hours finding out about the brilliant marine life that can be found in the Red Sea. The Jeddah aquarium is an ideal method to encounter the Red ocean''s submerged universe without the need to get wet! Children will wonder about the apparent multitude of various types of fish and corals and a stroll through the "fish burrow" where guests can watch sharks, turtles, beams, and fish swim above them.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It''s the best place to take your kids on the weekend on Jeddah by taking Lahore to Jeddah''s online tickets.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spend Day at the Beach</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There are some family peaceful private beaches to visit for a road trip situated in Jeddah''s North Obhur territory. The entire family can swim together at Coral Beach Resort, Salhiabeach, Sheraton, Oia, and La Plage beach. Ladies can swim in two-piece and bathing suits on the private seashores. A large portion of these spots do require a yearly enrollment yet some permit day passes also.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the best open seashores in Jeddah, the New Corniche zone is sheltered with quiet waters that consider kids and men to swim.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eating Out</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Jeddah has many extraordinary family well-disposed eateries, a considerable lot of which can be found along the Corniche and Red Sea shopping center. Papaya café, which is directly close to Souk Shatee, is situated inside an indoor tropical nursery with little wellsprings and light rolling in from the glass rooftop—suggested, particularly for breakfast and noon.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the nights, evaluate the eateries close to the waterfront. Another lovely outside spot by the ocean is eatery Angelina.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Visit the UNESCO Site in Jeddah</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The most important site in Jeddah that drove me to investigate it further was the noteworthy old city known as Al Balad. It has likewise been perceived and ensured by UNESCO. A ton of the structures there are getting a little touchup, henceforth the development work in a portion of the photographs. There is a great deal to find here, for example, the structures from an external perspective and within.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of them are open to the general society to see—however, knowledge about the opening and shutting time. Early afternoon is certainly not an incredible opportunity to visit most things in Jeddah, so I would guidance you to go in the early evening from 4 pm or early at 6pm. You can do a few shopping for conventional things and gold there too.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These are some of the best things to do on weekends in Jeddah.

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this article, we''ll look at the best places to visit in Mecca during your Umrah.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jannatul Mualla</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This graveyard is about a ten-minute drive from the Great Mosque of Mecca. Some places become a priority for visitors because of the concentration in the vicinity of the famous mosque. It, along with the Genie Mosque, is easily accessible on any schedule, however tight. Here are buried relatives and dear to the Prophet (peace be upon him), namely Hazrat Khadija (may God be pleased with her) and Hazrat Abu Talib, who supported him throughout his life.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This fact alone is enough to express our special interest in this site. Our Prophet''s grandfather Abdul Muttalib and great-grandfather Abd Munaaf also live in the cemetery. Pay your respects to the inhabitants of the cemetery.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Hundreds of thousands of people fly from Karachi for Umrah, and you can take <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/umrah-packages"><strong>Umrah Packages Karachi 2020</strong></a> this year for your Umrah travel.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jabbal-e-Noor</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Located at the top of Jabal Al Noor, you can visit the sacred cave of Hira (Ghari Hira). It was here that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) received the initial revelations of the Koran in 610 BC. Jabal-al Noor is another famous name for this mountain because of the light on it at night. The Prophet felt a growing need for isolation and began to feel more and more lonely before receiving revelations from Angel Jibreel (AS). He was visiting the Hira Cave and meditating day and night with supplies for himself.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mount Arafat</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Almost a million pilgrims visit Mount Arafat every year during their pilgrimage. According to the hadith, Mount Arafat is where all the Muslims who will be responsible for the time of resurrection will gather. Mount Arafat is of great importance during the pilgrimage period.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Pilgrims visit it and perform pilgrimage rituals, pray and make important supplications (Dua) as the Sunnah Prophet Ibrahim (blessing).If you are from Islamabad, then consider taking umrah packages Islamabad 2020 for your Umrah travel.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mina</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The mine is located in the eastern part of Mecca and is a 5 km long valley. During the pilgrimage, pilgrims stay in this valley on the 8th day of Dhul Hajj, and then on the 10-13th day of Dhul Hajj. Mina is well known for how busy it is during the annual Hajj pilgrimage, also known as the "city of tents." More than 100,000 air-conditioned tents provide temporary accommodation for pilgrims visiting during the pilgrimage festival.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Jamarat Bridge is located in the Mina Valley. It is the stoning of the satanic ritual performed between sunrise and sunset on the last day of Hajj. Mina is where pilgrims threw stones in memory of the occasion when the Prophet Ibrahim stoned a Shaitan as he tried to stand between him and the order Allah had given him.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Site of Battle of Badr</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Battle of Badr is mentioned in the Koran because it was one of the first Islamic battles fought by the Prophet Muhammad. People can still get a glimpse of this battlefield when visiting the city of Mecca.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Battle of Badr is very important in Islamic history and was also very important to the lives of the Prophet and his followers, who fought for the only true and acceptable religion of Allah (SWT) against the Makkah''s pagans and won the battle with angles'' support.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This place is located almost 330 kilometres from Mecca. You can also take Umrah Packages Karachi 2020 if you are from the province of Sindh.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Masjid al-Jinn</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The incident related to this place, which is very supernatural in nature, aroused particular interest in this mosque. The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) was influencing them when reciting the Holy Qur''an to a group of passing Genies. No wonder these Genies felt the grace of these verses of the Koran and fell under their spell. The Holy Qur''an bears witness to this in Surah Jinn and gives a good basis for believing this incident.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The mosque was erected to celebrate this conversion. It can also be considered one of the representative examples of the architecture of the mosques that flourish in Mecca. It is visited only by men. Not because it''s a remote location or anything, it''s only a 10-minute spin from the Grand Mosque.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Women may praise it from afar, but cannot enter because the mosque does not support division properly into male and female chambers.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bir Tuwa</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is one of the valleys in Mecca that was once isolated and uneven. It is currently crowded with buildings. Today, the name Bir Tuva has been limited to a well in Jarwal, called Tuva. The Prophet spent the night at this well. Then in the morning, he purified himself of its water and entered Mecca. It is located at the bottom of Mecca towards the north in Jarwal. The word "Tuva" means a pleated well.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These are some of the most significant places in Makkah that you must visit while going to Saudi Arabia for Umrah. You can take umrah packages Islamabad 2020 for the comfort of your journey and pre-planned stay for convenience.</p>', N'holy-places-that-you-must-visit-while-offering-umrah', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 447, 1, CAST(N'2020-09-28T10:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Historical Back Ground Of Hajj</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s look over the occurrence of the Hajj or the history of it. When 1400 years ago, the caliphate and the followers back to Makah with the Holy Prophet for the purpose of the Hajj, then those accompanying noticed or observed all the steps very finely even every single move or step and spread it among the Muslins and wrote it on the books that are same as perform till nowadays.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The real history of the performance of this holy obligation is in the preference of the Prophet Ibrahim, his wife and his son. Prophet Ibrahim (Khalil UL Allah) and his son Prophet Ismael (zabee UL Allah) built the Khana khaba with the Order of Allah and the wall the black stone carved in the wall that angel Gabriel brought from the Paradise/heaven. Once Allah ordered to the Prophet Ibrahim, sent his wife and Islmail (A.S) in the desert (it was ancient Makah) lonely. The child (Hazrat Ismael) of Hagar (wife of Ibrahim A.S) was very thirsty and Hagar runs with anxiety for finding the water between the two hills Al Safa and the Al Marwa, even seven times continuously. The last seven times she returned then she saw a miracle by the Allah, Ismael scratching the ground for the thirst, from where the spring of water appeared naturally (SubhanAllah, it can happen in the dessert) and continuously flow out then the Hazrat Hagar put stones around it and said ZAM ZAM mean the water please stopped, stopped. This converted into the Well of ZAM ZAM and the water flow out from it even till the last day of the universe. Those steps of Hagar become the essential rituals of the Hajj all the runs around the both small two Hills then the Pilgrimage going to complete.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Further Rituals Of Hajj</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s discuss following steps which completed the Hajj are written below.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tarwiyah</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is the beginning of the Hajj, pilgrimers go to the Makah and move around it counter-clock-wise direction to the devotion towards only Khaliq e Haqeeqi, then they run around the Hills and go to the Mina (where the Prophet Ibrahim stoned the Iblees) for staying one night there.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arafah</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The holy Prophet (P.B.U.H) gave his last sermon and beliefs of all Muslims that in the Doomsday all souls will gather there.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stoning Jamrat Al Aqabah</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The last step of Hajj is to stoning the Devil as Hazrat Ibrahim stoned on it. We recommended to all the Muslims just pay <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/airblue-flights   "><strong>Air Blue Ticket Price</strong></a> and get the precious chance to perform this ritual in the healthy life.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eid Al Adha</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end, the sacrifices of Sheep or animals for the Allah as Allah replace the Sheep with the Hazrat Ismael (A.S) and offered the Namaz of Eid UL Adha as thanksgiving prayers.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tawaf Al Ifadha</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the final last Tawaf around Kaba before going to the Al-Haram in the sort of that, Allah fulfills the Hajj and for the love of Prophet Place which must have to leave in this day.</p>', N'hajj-journey-2019-things-you-should-know-about', N'Aqsa Tayyaba', NULL, 1158, 1, CAST(N'2019-08-02T11:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">With traditions of excellence dating back to hundreds of years and the presence of prestigious educational institutes on every corner, UK in general and London in particular have become the top destinations for the students everywhere. The universities of London have a remarkable reputation as they offer topnotch pedagogical flexibility that other English-speaking countries cannot.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the people of other countries, students living in Pakistan also prefer to pursue their higher studies in the universities of London. Pakistani students know that getting a degree from the educational institutes of London will critically define their career, and they would be able to have a substantial say in the job market. Here, we have thoroughly analyzed all the factors that compel the Pakistani students to continue their studies in London.</p>

<h3>1.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">High-Quality Education System Of UK</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Several countries of the world have incorporated the educational style of UK in their own schools and colleges. It clearly demonstrates the top-quality educational standards of the institutes of UK. Similarly, the international bodies regularly asses the standards of learning, research, and teaching to ensure that the set benchmarks are met. So, when a country offers such distinguished learning methods, who does not want to study in that country?</p>

<h3>2.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">International Recognition Of The Degree</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since Pakistan is not a developed country, acquiring the educational certifications of London is a dream for every Pakistani student. Once you get a degree from the universities of London, you will be in a position to represent yourself in any part of the world. It does not matter where you end up being employed; your educational credentials will be respected and recognized everywhere. As a result, your job foundation will be strengthened, and you will be able to find your dream job conveniently.</p>

<h3>3.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Excellent Language Skills</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">English is the international language for communication. There is no denying the fact that English language skills are crucial to excel in your career and to compete in the business market. However, due to the educational system of Pakistan, more than 90% of the students find it challenging to communicate and articulate their ideas in English. So, studying in the universities of London will help the students develop brilliant English language skills. Students living in Lahore always check <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/flights/cheap-flights-from-lahore-to-london   "><strong>Lahore To London Ticket Price</strong></a> before planning to go there.</p>

<h3>4.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Financial Support And Scholarships</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Pakistani students also prefer studying in London because they know that the official and private authorities would handle their educational expenditures. In London, various Universities offer scholarships for international students to support their study and living cost. If you have secured higher grades in your native country, then the authorities in the UK will sustain the entire burden of your studies. Moreover, there are also international student societies that collect the funds and assist needy students.</p>

<h3>5.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exposure To Multicultural Environment</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">London is a culturally diverse city, and spending some time there would give the Pakistani students a chance to experience a multicultural environment. In London, Pakistani students will meet a lot of people coming from various parts of the world. They will then learn different customs and traditions that will eventually help them to develop a plethora of skills that are necessary to be a part of the global workforce.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bottom Line</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Undoubtedly, world-class education in a multicultural society is everything you need to leisurely spend your entire life. If you are also among the people who want to get admission in the educational institutes of London, then book your online ticket through <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/   "><strong>faremakers.com</strong></a> Pakistan’s leading online travel channel.</p>', N'why-do-pakistani-students-prefer-to-study-in-london', N'Hamza Farooq', NULL, 790, 1, CAST(N'2019-11-29T09:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Serene Air is a privately owned Pakistani airline that operates in six major cities of Pakistan including Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad, Peshawar, Quetta, and Faisalabad. The airline is well-known for its exceptional services and excellent amenities. It started its operations in July 2017 and has been assisting the local passengers in their air travel ever since. Currently, Serene Air has 4 Boeing aircraft.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">International Flight Operations</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">However, it seems that after the success in the domestic arena, Serene Air is going to expand its horizons by offering flights also to the international destinations. As per the official reports, <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/serene-air-flights"><strong>Serene Air</strong></a> is all set to launch the flight operations to two major Arab countries, including UAE and Saudi Arabia. Details reveal that the airline will start its flight operations from Pakistan to Jeddah in April 2020. Similarly, with time, it will expand its operations to Medina city and the UAE.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Aircraft</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A spokesperson of the Serene Air has said that they have acquired two A-330 Airbuses and one Boeing 737-800. These aircraft have been obtained just for the sole purpose of international flights. The spokesperson further informed that the airline would get two more A-330 this month.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan has stated that in accordance with the new aviation policy, the private airlines would now be allowed to operate internationally. It will not only lessen the burden on the national flag carrier, but it will also enable the passengers to explore new avenues.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Meeting Of The Federal Cabinet</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, it is essential to remember that in January 2020, the federal cabinet under Prime Minister had approved the implementation of various decisions pertinent to the operations of airlines. In the same cabinet meeting, it was also finalized that a new airline would be launched. Basically, the meeting was summoned to discuss the 16-point agenda of reviewing national and international developments. The rising escalations between Iran and America due to the death of the Iranian General were also the point of discussion.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Launch of New Airline</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sources close to the cabinet members reported that the cabinet green-lighted the launch of a new airline, AirSial. In addition, the proposals related to the betterment of Pak-Saudi air services were also presented before the cabinet members.</p>', N'serene-air-is-going-to-launch-flight-operations-to-uae-and-saudi-arabia', N'Hamza Farooq', NULL, 970, 1, CAST(N'2020-03-07T10:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">People travel from one place to another all around the world because of many reasons and one of the biggest ones is of tourism. But there are also many people who travel for business as well as for education purposes. Not only did the COVID-19 affect tourism but it also greatly impacted the business as education as well. Students from Pakistan who were living abroad could easily take their <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/pakistan-international-airlines-flights"><strong>PIA Flights</strong></a> whenever they wanted. But it wasn''t the case after the outbreak of the global pandemic. The same is the case for the students studying in Malaysia as they were restricted to travel. But the tables now are turning as the PIA office at Kuala Lumpur Malaysia announced a piece of great news for the students. Here are all the details about this latest news.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Details of PIA Opening Travel to Malaysia for Students</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Very recently the PIA office at Kuala Lumpur Malaysia has announced that now students from Pakistan can take PIA flights as they are now allowing students to travel to Malaysia. But this news will take effect from the second week of March. It means that you now have a handsome window in which you can prepare for your travel by completing all the important documents and other important things.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Important Considerations to Keep in Mind</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The PIA officials have also said that it''s important for the students that they must carry at least 4000 MYR (Ringgit) of cash while travelling. That''s because they will have to pay for quarantine administrative and SWAB charges once they will be arriving at the KL (Kuala Lumpur) Airport. The amount will be paid to the Ministry of Health directly. Moreover, students also need to keep in mind that they will also have to show the negative results of their recent PCR test. The test must be taken in the last 72 hours of their flight otherwise it will not be considered legit.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The requirements seem a little tough but the fact of the matter is that these are the least possible ones. There are places and there are also airlines other than PIA who are issuing even more strict regulations and rules especially if you want to travel to Europe or America. It''s still not less than a blessing that the travel to Kuala Lumpur is now opening for the students for their studies.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Make sure that you complete all your required documents and everything that you need for your travel before time. Additionally, we also advise you to ensure that you meet all the requirements mentioned by the airline and Malaysian government as mentioned above. It will allow you to have seamless and safe travel where you won''t need to face any unwanted and unnecessary situations. You can take your PIA flights to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia as soon as they start to continue with your academic career.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As mentioned so often earlier, all the airlines from all around the world are trying hard to get more customers.

The same is the case with Virgin Atlantic Airlines that has operated its first-ever A350 flight from Manchester to Islamabad. If you want to book cheap flights to Islamabad from Manchester, then consider reading this article till the very end to understand how this experience will feel like.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Equipment</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Virgin Atlantic has changed gears and upgraded its equipment for the first time. Instead of using 264-seat 787-9 boing, the airline always uses four four-times within a single week; this time, Virgin Atlantic used its flagship aircraft (A350-1000). This upgrade served all the passengers well and took them by surprise. Not only did it offer better services, but it was a new experiment for all the travellers, and they were more than just happy with it.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Details of the Flight</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This flight took off from Manchester international airport at about 11:38, which was only several minutes late than its planned schedule. The aircraft quickly reached an altitude of about 39,000 feet, and it started making its way to Pakistan through Europe. It entered Asia at its due time by flying over the Caspian and the Black sea. After entering Asia, the aircraft was welcomed by Turkmenistan and then Afghanistan. Finally, it reached its destination, none other than the most beautiful capital of the whole world, Islamabad.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You can also <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>book cheap flights</strong></a> to have your journey on this flying beast with Virgin Atlantic. As mentioned, the flight departed from Manchester a little late, but it covered the gap mid-flight and reached Islamabad 45 minutes earlier. The time it took made it a special flight because other flights usually take a lot more time.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Details of Aircraft</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You can certainly book Virgin Atlantic cheap flights to experience this new flight, which is fast and safe. That’s because this aircraft was only 1.7 years old. It was delivered to the airline back in the September of 2019. It offers 335 seats, and it’s by far the largest airbus in the Virgin Atlantic airline fleet. The seat distribution of this aeroplane is as followed:</p>

<ul>
<li>44 in Upper Class</li>
<li>56 in premium economy</li>
<li>235 in economy</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The sears, as compared to the aircraft that used to fly earlier, are much more luxurious and comfortable.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why this New Aircraft</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Virgin Atlantic has added this airbus to the Pakistan route because of the Easter holidays as the demand for seats is too high. Moreover, this demand is most probably will remain high in the whole next month. That’s why this aircraft was added, but now it seems that it will need to continue for a while as the United Kingdom has added Pakistan to the red list.</p>', N'virgin-atlantic-operated-its-first-manchester-to-islamabad-a350-flight', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 335, 1, CAST(N'2021-04-05T10:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">By visiting sacred places through <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/umrah-packages"><strong>Cheap Umrah Packages Islamabad 2020</strong></a>, you can quickly sketch in memory a historical occasion or personality associated with the place. All pilgrims are interested in different places that play a significant role in the history of Islam. As Muslims, we should be aware of our remarkable history.Indeed, for Muslims, Masjid Nabawi is the most beautiful and eye-catching holy place in Medina.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">But consider visiting the following places in Medina while offering Umrah.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Masjid-e-Quba</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Quba Mosque is the oldest mosque of Islam and is one of three historically important mosques in Medina. Its great respect and importance come from the fact that it was founded by the Prophet Muhammad P.B.U.H.when he was going back to Makkah.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As old as it seems to be, it has a particular wonder and could be lovelier than being worked by the best man the world has ever observed.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Garden of Hazrat Salman Farsi R.A</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This notable garden results from 300 date palms planted by the Prophet Muhammad P.B.U.H. himself to free his darling buddy Salman Farsi R.A. from imprisonment. Salman Farsi R.A. was the initial individual to interpret the Koran into a Persian language. There are still date palms in the nursery, and huge dates show up here every year.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is located near Masjid Quba, and you should visit it when traveling to Medina. You can take many Umrah Packages in Pakistan, but we advise you to choose the one that suits you the best.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Masjid Al-Qiblatain</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are interested in architecture, you will immediately fall in love with this mosque. It consists of traditional design with minarets, double domes, and a raised prayer hall. What makes this mosque unique? Every mosque has qibla, the direction in which Muslims pray, or the Holy Kaaba in Mecca. However, at the time of this mosque, the qibla pointed towards Jerusalem.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Allah''s revelation instructed Muslims to pray towards the Kaaba, after which all mosques had to change their qiblas.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jabal Uhud</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The early Islamic period was a great challenge for Muslims. Islam was still in its outset, and its adversaries were developing. The Muslims have fought three battles with Kufaar-e-Makkah, and the battle of Uhud has its weight. It is known that Mount Uhud has aroused the interest of pilgrims for centuries. The plain bordering this mountain served as a battlefield. Highlights are the Archer''s Mound, Uhud Cave, and Martyrs'' Cemetery.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Only a few can climb, and even that because of their curiosity, motivation, and health. The recommended precautions are, above all, good pace and hydration.Also, do not entrust your goods to other people or take anything from them. It is the reason why so many pilgrims travel with ease.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Well of Hazrat Uthman R.A</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This 1,400year-old well belongs to the Holy Prophet''s very close companion P.B.U.H., Hazrat Usman R.A. The Prophet P.B.U.H., stated, "Whoever purchased this well from a Jew and gave free water to the Muslims went legitimately to Janna." At that point, Hazrat Usman R.A. complied with the Prophet''s P.B.U.H. order and gave free water from the well to all Muslims.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a living site of Islamic lessons that Muslims are pleased with. If you are planning to visit Hijaz this year to offer Umrah, consider taking umrah packages Islamabad.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Masjid e Ghamama</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a non-existent mosque from ancient times, right next to Roza-e-Rasool, and marks the Prophet (peace be upon him) led the Eid prayer. But these Eid prayers were not offered in any suitable mosque. Far away from here! The Saudi government later built the mosque that pilgrims see today. However, for another reason, it is called the Ghamama Mosque. The Prophet P.B.U.H. has visited this plain on other occasions other than Eiden.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On one such event, he needed to petition God for a downpour. What''s more, since the climate was shady when the Prophet P.B.U.H. asked there, it enlivened the mosque''s name. Ghamama implies mists.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Al-Medina Museum</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Situated on King Abdul Aziz Street in the City of Knowledge in Medina, it is the first and most established exhibition hall in Medina gave to Islam''s set of experiences.

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">China had opened its doors to the world in the ’70s, and since then, it has experienced a period of astonishing growth and prosperity. Now, more and more foreign tourists are visiting China by <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/china-southern-airlines-flights"><strong>China Southern Airlines</strong></a> to experience the rich history and to catch a glimpse of its shining future.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is no surprise that China allures millions of tourists each year. The ancient wonders, provocative cuisine, historical monuments, and the top-notch enterprise system can impress even the deaf and the blind. Also, the significance of the Great Wall of China is so unparalleled that describing it in words is near to impossible.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though the modernization of the country has streamlined the tourism activities, there are still some hurdles that might cause inconvenience for the people who are unprepared and unaware. This piece is intended to tell the people about the pivotal things that they must need to know before visiting this beautiful yet challenging country. Unquestionably, keeping these things in mind will prepare you for unexpected circumstances.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cultural Etiquette</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">China is a reserved society, and foreigners mustn''t spoil Chinese traditions. While meeting the Chinese people for the first time, try to be somewhat formal. Instead of hugging, go for a gentle handshake. Chinese people find it uncomfortable when a stranger tries to hug or kiss them. Similarly, do not show off and avoid open displays of love and affection.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Carry Your Passport All the Time</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While roaming around, make sure that you are carrying your passport or at least the photocopy of the passport. It is due to the reason that after noticing your foreign attire and physique, the police might demand you about your personal credentials. If you do not have anything to show to them, or if your visa is expired, then you would be in big trouble. So, keep yourself prepared for unexpected official questions.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You Will Always Be Served With Hot Water</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Chinese love hot water and tea. Even at the lavish hotels, you will have a hard time finding bottled or cold water. Similarly, no meal is complete unless it is served with hot water. It is widely believed in China that consuming hot boiled water increases one’s ability to counter the disease. So, it is best to bring your own bottled water; otherwise, you will be negotiating for days but would still not get even the sight of cold water!</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VPN Is A Must</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As soon as you land in the country after booking a <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/pakistan-international-airlines-flights"><strong>PIA Online Ticket</strong></a>, you would not be able to access the major websites, including Google, Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, and Twitter, etc. Due to the cold war between the communist regime and the west, it is the policy of the Chinese government not to allow any western sites in their country. You can only access these platforms if you have a good VPN installed on your mobile or laptop. So, never forget to install a VPN to connect with your friends in China.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Regulations For Students</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Chinese policies are severe towards international students, and you might get expelled from the Chinese institutes in case of the violation of the rules. If you have a study visa, then strictly adhere to the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never take part in any political activity either inside or outside the institute.</li>
<li>You would be instantly expelled if you are found to be involved in any brawl.</li>
<li>Never violate any traffic rules.</li>
<li>Do not take pictures of crime scenes or police activities.</li>
<li>Never raise funds.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Language Barrier</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though the new generation of China is learning English, you will not be able to communicate with the older ones in a foreign language. It would be a blessing if you are able to find a native Chinese who could understand English. So, it is essential to tackle the language barrier smartly. You can either hire a tour guide or install the translator app to communicate conveniently.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unpredictable Weather</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nobody can really predict the weather in China. At one moment, it might be sunny, while on the other; you might be experiencing heavy rainfall. Generally, summers are hotter as the temperature can go up to 40oC. However, the winters can be severe, given the temperature could go as low as -20oC. Additionally, smog has recently become a major problem in various cities in China. Therefore, bringing a good jacket, air pollution mask, umbrella, or plastic poncho can save you from unnecessary impediments.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bottom Line</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">China is a massive country with a diverse history and strict culture. If you go to China by keeping the above-mentioned things in mind, then it would be the most unforgettable itinerary of your life.</p>

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Bangkok is the capital and the most populous city of Thailand, known for elegant shrines and energetic street life. Colorful, smile-inducing, fascinating, pristine, crowded, and noisy; you can add as many adjectives as you want to describe the city. The city is overwhelming, so be prepared to embrace a plethora of supreme attractions once you come here through <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/thai-airways-flights"><strong>Thai Airways</strong></a>. There is so much to do in Bangkok that sampling all the things is impossible, but we have put together these four attractions that are considered the major tourist spots of Bangkok.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Giant Swing</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Situated in front of Wat Suthat, the 27-meter high swing is one of the most eye-catching sights in Bangkok. It was built in 1700 for traditional Brahmin ceremonies. However, the lightning damaged it later, and so it naturally became decorative. After its erection, the swing was the primary focus of the annual religious ceremony held after the rice harvest. Various gymnasts would showcase their skills by performing dangerous acts on the swing. Teams of three would attempt to catch a bag of coin in their teeth while taking turns on the narrow board. However, following a number of deadly incidents, King Rama banned the contest in 1932.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wat Pho</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Certainly, looking at the jaw-dropping size of the statue of Reclining Buddha would leave you spellbound. The statue is so big that you would not be able to capture it entirely with your camera. The 46-meter-long and the 14-meter-high statue is surrounded by the Wat Pho, also known as the Temple of Reclining Buddha. This magnanimous statue stares up at the ceiling in enlightenment. Though the primary attraction in the temple is this statue, tourists can also indulge in observing the attractive murals that depict over 400 images of Buddha.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grand Palace</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ideal for family and couples, the iconic Grand Palace is located in the heart of the city. The palace was the official residence of King Rama, but now it hosts a number of royal events, including marriages and ceremonies. The palace will give you a chance to observe the royal life up-close, which will compel you to think how ordinary your normal life is. The pristine and lush green ground of the palace will force you to stay here for good. In addition, you can also admire the sheer grandeur of the Temple of Emerald Buddha, which is also situated here.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chatuchak Market</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Chatuchak Market is the largest semi-outdoor weekend market in the world. From religious icons and jewelry to high-quality fabrics and pet supplies, shoppers will be spoilt for choice here. The fascinating 15,000 stalls in the market offer anything you can ever dream of. Surprisingly, all the essential commodities are available at a much lower price than any other market in Bangkok.

We have also made list of some activities which are to be done by everyone.
<h2><strong>List of Activities To Be Done</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Recitation of Quran</strong></p></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eve of New Year should started by recitation of Holy Quran which is the latest and Final Testament revealed to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Words of Holy Quran give us spiritual comfort because it is the word of Allah Almighty. There are numerous advantages for recitation of Holy Quran. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) had also taught us to learn and acts on noble words of Holy Quran.</p>
<h3><strong>Recitation of Durood Sharif</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Durood Sharif is extremely important for everyone. Recitation of Durood Sharif has been emphasized in Holy Quran. Durood Ibrahim is only true Durood which has been told by our Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). It is narrated in Tirmidhi that reciter of Durood gets ten rewards from Allah Almighty and his ten good deeds are written. Durood Sharif should be recited more and more on 31st December 2017.</p>
<h3><strong>Praying for New Year</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prayers are very important for New Year. We have to make our plans and resolutions for New Year. Praying is extremely necessary in this regards. We should pray to Allah Almighty for our guidance to right path, health of all human beings. We also pray that Allah Almighty should finish everyone''s&rsquo;s problems. May He grant us power of living happily with others? We also have to pray for our better financial life because economic problems are major source of destruction between families, smaller companies, multinational brands, governments and states.</p>
<h3><strong>Making Positive Resolution</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have to make our plans and resolutions for New Year. Resolutions are very important for us. We take care of our assessment in the previous year and then set goals for New Year. We can set very positive goals in life like learning and teaching Quran, starting up our own business, teaching education and other positive category of goals. A year in life is very important aspect of life.<br />
<h3><strong>Sharing Happiness</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People also like to celebrate their happiness with others. They meet their relatives, friends, family, colleagues and business partners. Delicious dishes are prepared for celebration of New Year. People also like to go to restaurants, shopping malls and other public areas for celebration with their families. Government, Military and other private organizations have their own functions. There are also several other visitors. You should also celebrate New Year Eve and Day with positive aspects. </p>', N'list-of-most-popular-activities-to-be-done-on-new-year', N'Tahir Ahmad', NULL, 1627, 1, CAST(N'2017-12-30T13:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Latest News About Flights to Swat</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Pakistan has faced many troubles with time. First the terrorist activity in the whole country, especially in the northern and west-northern region. The land was almost recovered from that trouble, then suddenly, the novel COVID-19 took over the entire world. Not only did it take most of the countries by surprise, but it also stopped air travel entirely in many countries. Pakistan is also one of the countries where the COVID-19 hit considerably.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">PIA was already planning to resume many closed flights and airports. But because of the latest trouble, all of the plans go somewhere in the back because the country had to deal with the global pandemic.

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">You might have already heard that the vaccine for the COVID-19 is finally out. Conspiracies aside, it’s one of the biggest news in a while that we as a human race have heard. We should although celebrate it. but the fact of the matter is that no one should get carried away with this news because the most important thing is to stay humble. Moreover, even though airlines have been offering ridiculously <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>cheap air fares</strong></a> and also playing some other tactics but how the COVID-19 vaccine will affect travel positively will be unparalleled.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this article, we will discuss how will the travel look after the vaccine and we will also discuss whether it will be safe to travel around the world or not. So, keep reading to make sure that your air travel remains safe.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Keep in mind that there is No Vaccine for the Fear</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">we all know that COIVD-19 is one of the biggest fears right now and it won’t vanish away easily. It will take time. regardless of the airline whether it is Virgin Atlantic Cheap Flights people are taking or any other luxury and safe airline, the fact of fear flies beside them.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To get back on air travel, the world needs herd immunity, which is believed to be achieved when about 70 percent of the population has protective antibodies.

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Travel Regulations Will Be Stricter Than Ever</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Keep in mind that you’ll face some strict rules and regulations that are already have applied by all the airlines. Whether you’ll take <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/virgin-atlantic-flights"><strong>Virgin Atlantic Cheap Flights</strong></a> or from any other carrier you’ll need to follow the regulation and fulfil the requirements to travel especially internationally. Contactless travel will also become the most common standard at most airports thanks to the use of biometric technology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">And travelers should expect temperature control and limited onboard services to be the new norm. Long periods of quarantine are one of the biggest obstacles to restarting international tourism. Few people can afford 14 days in a quarantined hotel apart from vacation. Potential alternatives are tested.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the new COVID variant emerged, British Airways and American Airlines were piloting a voluntary testing program for certain passengers to avoid the UK''s mandatory 14-day quarantine period. In mid-December, the UK government also implemented a new test and release policy that could reduce the quarantine period to five days for people arriving from abroad.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Business is Restarting</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The International Air Transport Association expects the airline industry to not return to pre-pandemic levels until at least 2024. This means that restarting tourism will require the restoration of transport infrastructure and networks, especially in aviation and cruise lines. Many planes are currently parked in the deserts of the US and Australia.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">They will need to be recovered and thoroughly serviced before flights can start again. But it''s not as simple as just taking the planes into the air. A more serious challenge for airlines will be to restore air routes while ensuring their sustainable profitability. As airlines slowly re-expand these networks, travelers will have to endure less frequent connections, longer journeys, and lengthy stopovers. However, there is some encouraging news. In the United States, domestic ticket prices have fallen and while international flight schedules have been drastically curtailed, low demand has caused some prices to drop.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Smaller and more agile airlines should do better. And expect smaller and more efficient planes to become more common as well. keep in mind that it’s quite possible that people don’t go for <a href="https://blog.faremakers.com/Blog/2019/9/19/7-things-to-do-for-long-haul-flight">long-haul flights</a> for a while. In the meantime, airports will require temporary or permanent reconfiguration to handle new public health checkups and examinations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It can be yet another possible frustration for travelers. Journey ships or you can say the cruise ships and port terminals will confront comparable necessities, as will inns and other convenience suppliers.</p>', N'is-it-safe-to-travel-around-the-globe-after-covid-19-vaccine', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 539, 1, CAST(N'2021-02-08T09:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">The city of dreams is a paramount place for artists, dreamers, tourists, and anyone who has a passion for exploration. Due to the diverse culture and convincing fashion, the city fills everyone with an enigmatic verve. Its stunning skyline and the out-of-the-world cuisine have the potential to put a magical spell on your soul. Indeed, your imagination towards the sightseeing would immediately change as soon as you breathe the air of this city.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though the hustle-and-bustle of New York fascinates everyone who prefers <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>Cheap Flight Tickets</strong></a>, the city can also prove to be an intimidating place for first-time visitors. The cacophony of the crowd and the fast-moving life of the city might completely overwhelm your nerves, and you might deviate from the regular path.  So, first-time travelers must get an in-depth knowledge of the unwritten code of conduct of the city. Luckily, we have come up with ten vital things that will help you to spend your days like a real New Yorker. Let’s get started.</p>

<h3>1.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best Time To Visit New York</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You can visit this bustling city whenever you want. Each season in the city offers a number of reasons to visit. Early fall is suitable for the tourists looking for bright sun and comfortable temperatures while the late fall is perfect for the holiday decorations and Thanksgiving Day Parade.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, December to January is deep wintry season, but it also means better hotel rates. Plus, you will also have the chance to celebrate Christmas with unwavering zeal. The citizens of Pakistan get discounts on New York flights as the <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/pakistan-international-airlines-flights"><strong>PIA Airline Ticket Price</strong></a> goes down during Christmas. The city welcomes the spring with extraordinary pomp as the people shop at outdoor markets, dance in the streets, and dine outside. The days of summer are hotter, and you can beat the heat by going to the nearby beaches.</p>

<h3>2.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don’t Stop Walking</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">People in New York walk fast, and it is important to maintain your pace and don’t stop walking. If you stop in the middle of the sidewalk, not only will you be hit by the walkers, but you will also invite their anger.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is because the life in New York has a magical flow to it, and not disrupting that flow would be a saner approach. However, if you are tired or want to take a photo, then step to the side. Similarly, if you are traveling in the group or are standing on the escalators, then make sure you are not blocking the sidewalk. Leave a little space for others so that they can get around you.</p>

<h3>3.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use The Inexpensive Subway</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The traffic in New York is horrible, and the taxis in the city are quite expensive. For instance, a 20-minute taxi ride will cost you about $40, which is definitely not worth it. However, if you prefer the subway, then you can get there in the same amount of time for under $4.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You can only use the subway if you have a metro card, which can be easily acquired through any subway station. The best way to get around the subway is through Google Maps. You just have to mention your direction and select the transit option. The app will conveniently inform you about the routes and stations.</p>

<h3>4.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don’t Bring Your Car To The Streets</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Driving or parking in New York City would not be an economical idea. If you drive your vehicle on the roads, you would be shocked to see the highly expensive cost of the bridge tolls. Similarly, finding a cheap parking place is nearly impossible as you would be charged as much as $100 for one-day parking.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have a car, then try to find the parking lot near Newark airport or New Jersey transit station. Here, you can park your car for the whole day in less than $25. However, if you can’t find the appropriate parking spot, then we recommend you download a parking app which will not only inform you about the available parking garages but also show you the cheapest ones.</p>

<h3>5.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Know What To Tip</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Tipping is a complicated choice while visiting any new city. In New York, you will be considered a penny-pincher if you don’t tip for restaurants, cabbies, bellhops, and other services. Generally, you are supposed to give 15% to 20% tip of your total bill. The workers do not like it when you give them only a few cents.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to taxis, most of them have an automated system where you can select the tip percentage. So, you must need to have enough money in your wallet if you want to be looked like a respectable person in New York.</p>

<h3>6.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don’t Go To Times Square Unless You’re A Broadway Fan</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Times Square is a combination of overpriced things, chain restaurants, and huge crowds. You should certainly not visit Times Square during the day or rush hour. However, you can go there at night because the streets and shops would not be hugely crowded. Most of the shops here often charge extravagant prices, but if you do the proper research, then you can buy the same things at lower rates.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At night, Times Square is like daylight, and you will be able to capture the photos in the enlightening atmosphere. Indeed, it will look like it is the day of Christmas.</p>

<h3>7.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">There Are Plenty Of Budget Options</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is true that New York is one of the most expensive cities in the world to live and visit, but it does not mean at all that you can’t find the budget options. Indeed, you can find plenty of shops where the essential commodities are amazingly inexpensive.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Manhattan, you can enjoy a number of free activities like concerts, music plays, and games. Similarly, you don’t need a car to go from one place to another. You can go anywhere in the city by public transport. In Chinatown, there are lots of cheap hotels from where you can satiate your food craving with the delicious cuisine.</p>

<h3>8.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Public Bathrooms Are Rare In New York</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Never forget to go to bathroom before you leave your resting place or hotel because it is extremely hard to find public toilets in the city. If you are outside and want to go to the bathroom, then look for Penn Station or the Grand Central Terminal. Or you can also use a special trick that would never fail. Just walk confidently into a famous hotel or bar and go straight to their bathroom. Keep in mind that confidence is the key. The onlookers will not bother to talk to you if your body language is reassuring.</p>

<h3>9.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoid The People Dressed In Costume</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When you visit an area that is crowded, you will notice a lot of Mickey’s, Spiderman’s and other movie characters dressed in enigmatic costumes. If you take a photo with them, they will instantly start demanding payment even though they did not inform you earlier that the photo would cost money. They can demand as high as $10 for a photo. Some of them also jump into your photos intentionally. So, try to avoid them if you really want to save some bucks.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, other guys will try to sell their CD by telling you ludicrous and fabricated tales. Don’t buy the CD from them as it could be a blank disc.</p>

<h3>10.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best Dishes To Eat In New York</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from offering the best shopping malls and stunning skyscrapers, the Big Apple is also acclaimed for its delicious cuisine. From spicy pizzas and sandwiches to the traditional falafel, New York has plenty of food items to keep you satisfied and occupied. The magical cuisine of New York is sure to leave you hungry for another visit. People living in Pakistan generally book <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/flights/cheap-flights-from-lahore-to-new-york"><strong>Lahore To New York Flights</strong></a> just to taste the heavenly dishes of New York.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Bagel burger with cream cheese and smoked fish is popular among connoisseurs, while the dollar slice is the favorite item for the Pizza lovers. Furthermore, the exotic falafel with the fresh veggies will leave you stunned. Last but not least, if you are a rice lover, then the “meat over rice” dish will fulfill your appetite.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you follow the essential pieces of advice mentioned in this article, no one would ever know whether you are a first-time traveler or an experienced New Yorker. Make sure to get a handy guidebook before you arrive so that you can conveniently explore everything. If you have finalized your plans for New York, then visit <strong>faremakers.com</strong> and book the online ticket for a smooth journey.</p>', N'10-imperative-things-to-know-before-you-travel-to-new-york-city', N'Hamza Farooq', NULL, 904, 1, CAST(N'2020-01-11T09:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

So, consider reading it till the very end to make sure that you opt for the flights the right way.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Resumption of PIA Flights Booking to Toronto</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On 21st June 2021, the spokesperson of the PIA said that the officials from Canada have now officially allowed the flagship carrier of Pakistan to start offering PIA flight booking to Toronto. It was also mentioned that the flight operations of Pakistan International Airlines were restricted only to cargo flights. The primary and apparent reason behind this was COVID-19. But now, as the vaccination is being done on a larger scale and people are now getting safe from the virus, the flight operations are resuming. So, if you want to opt for Lahore to Toronto flights for business purposes or just for the sake of tourism, then now you can.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flights of Other Pakistani Carriers</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The official from the Pakistan International Airline said that the flights are only resuming via PIA. Other carriers of Pakistan will not offer Lahore to Toronto flights or from any other city. Moreover, there will be multiple phases that the Pakistan International Airline will follow. This is to make sure that all the passengers will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel">travel</a> between this route safely. Moreover, it will also help the airline make sure that all the SOPs of covid-19 are being followed strictly by the people booking PIA flights to Toronto.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the first phase, the flagship carrier of Pakistan will only offer three different direct flights to Toronto. The spokesperson also mentioned with emphasis that there would be no compromise on the COVID-19 restriction, and any person violating that will not be able to travel. All the officials will be instructed to make sure that all the standard operating procedures are being followed. That is because the chief executive of Pakistan International Airline has assured the government of Canada that all the people will book the best PIA flights keenly against COVID-19 SOPs.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Precautionary Measures in Place</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to note that all the crew members and staff of Pakistan International Airlines have already been vaccinated against COVID-19. Moreover, PIA is now making sure that every last employee is also vaccinated. The spokesperson of the Pakistan International Airline said that it is a very appreciable step because PIA is the first airline in the whole region to do so. It will also encourage the people <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/flights/cheap-flights-from-lahore-to-toronto"><strong>booking Lahore to Toronto flights</strong></a>.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When the Booking will Start</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr Arshad Malik, the Air Marshal and the chief executive officer of the PIA, has instructed the PIA staff and team members to start processing the PIA flights to Toronto immediately. Moreover, the officials said that if all the things go in the right direction, most probably the Airline will start operating on the coming Sunday.</p>', N'pia-resumes-direct-flights-to-toronto', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 452, 1, CAST(N'2021-06-23T07:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p><strong>Importance of Ramadan</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ramadan </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">is the most holy month for Muslims. &nbsp;They observe fast and worship in the most exceptional way. It is said in the Holy Quran:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;</span><strong>&rsquo;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The month of Ramadan is that in which was revealed the Quran; a guidance for mankind, and clear proofs of the guidance, and the criterion (of right and wrong). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And whosoever of you is present, let him fast the month, and whosoever of you is sick or on a journey, a number of other days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allah desires for you ease; He desires not hardship for you; and that you should complete the period, and that you should magnify Allah for having guided you, and that perhaps you may be thankful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 2, Verse 185.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People has given sadaqah in abundance because it is ordered by Allah Almighty in the Glorious Quran that,</span></p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;&rsquo; </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">And whoever volunteers good &ndash; then indeed, Allah is appreciative and Knowing.&rdquo; [Quran, 2: 158]]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;And those who are patient, seeking the countenance of their Lord, and establish prayer and spend from what We have provided for them secretly and publicly and prevent evil with good &ndash; those will have the good consequence of [this] home&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holy Quran is also recited more and more for getting Sawab from Allah Almighty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some tips from us for travelling in Ramzan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<p><strong>Offer Prayers Before Reaching Any Place</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is better to offer nawafil for going out of house. You will get more Sawab and the business transaction will also bless. &nbsp;Do Not Forget to Say Bismillah before for doing any transaction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talk with everyone politely. After Iftari, one can easily offer nawafil and before Taraweeh. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
<p><strong>Do Iftar At Best Restaurants of City</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Deals are provided at the restaurants. Many of them are available in the form of buffet which can be consumed easily by large family. &nbsp;Everyone wants to do Iftar and it can be done best at some of the restaurant. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>View the recent promotions for getting Cheap Flights </strong></p>
<p><strong>Take Care of Time</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time is very important especially for month of Ramadan. We have to pray more. We also need to go out for different purposes. Shopping increases after 15 month. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I advise you to keep a balance between them. &nbsp;It is also very important for us to keep great character while going out because good manners are also important component of Islam. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><strong><br /></strong><strong>Spend Chand Raat in Better Way</strong></p>

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Gulf Air is the national flag carrier of Kingdom of Bahrain. Quite recently, it has announced that flight operations out of Pakistan would be resumed from May 31, 2020. The officials have confirmed that for now, only the direct flights from Islamabad to the Bahrain International Airport will be made functional. It has further clarified that the flights from other cities of Pakistan will be resumed in the coming days. Here, it is worth noting that the flights will only take passengers out of Pakistan because the Civil Aviation Authority has not yet permitted the resumption of inbound flights.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gulf Air Destinations In Pakistan</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Like all the other airlines, Gulf air had also suspended its flight operations to various countries including Pakistan. The primary reason for the suspension was COVID-19 outbreak, which is still wreaking havoc all across the globe. Before the discontinuation, Gulf Air was operating to seven destinations in Pakistan (Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi, Faisalabad, Multan, Sialkot, and Peshawar). After the orders from CAA on March 21, 2020, the airlines stopped its activities in all the seven cities. But now, it will start escorting passengers back to Bahrain from Islamabad.</p>

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">If you plan to <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/british-airways-flights"><strong>buy online British Airways flights</strong></a>, you must know about the Covid-19 vaccine passport. Here is everything you must know.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On Monday, May 17, the restriction on foreign travel was lifted in England, with countries placed on the green, amber, or red travel lists. The traffic light system outlines the procedures for returning to the United Kingdom from certain nations; however, domestic travel rules differ by destination. In this article, you’ll learn whether you can book Lahore to London flights and other international flights to or from the UK.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">COVID-19 Vaccine Now Work as Passport</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Some nations require travellers to present a ''vaccine passport'' before entering, which means they must show proof of immunization before visiting. You need to know about vaccine passport, including which countries require them.</p>

<p>
<strong>Must Read:</strong> <a style="color:Purple;" href="https://blog.faremakers.com/Blog/2020/5/7/book-special-flights-for-london-with-pia"><strong>Book Flights For London With PIA</strong></a>
</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How Can You Get a Covid-19 Vaccine Passport</span>?</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Health Service Vaccine Passport application now offers the coronavirus vaccine passports to people who have already been vaccinated against Covid-19. Before travelling to specified locations, you can use the application to show that you have had two doses of the coronavirus vaccine. Keep in mind that it’s a different app from the NHS (National Health Service) for coronavirus tracing and tracking. You will need to install it and fill in the required information using your preferred device.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You''ll then have full access to your medical information and services, including the ability to communicate your Covid-19 vaccination status. The app also has several other functions, such as viewing a list of your NHS medicines and requesting medical advice. It’s essential to bear in mind that Pakistanis are not yet allowed to travel to the United Kingdom because of the extended restrictions.

<p style="text-align: justify;">It means you still can opt for <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/flights/cheap-flights-from-lahore-to-london"><strong>Lahore to London flights</strong></a> from the Pakistani carriers in normal circumstances. Still, you can book these flights from other airlines if you possess test results with the negative status for coronavirus or are already vaccinated.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who is allowed to Use this App</span>?</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyone who wants to use the app can easily do it, but the only restriction is age. All the user of the application must be 13 or more years old. If you have an iPhone or Android device, you can download the app and fill in your information, and it will connect to your GP information immediately.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">COVID-19 Vaccine Passport</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Italy, Iceland, Greece, and Spain are the only four nations that accept confirmation of vaccination before immigration. To travel to these countries, you must have a vaccine passport or confirmation of a recent negative Covid-19 test. However, not all of these places are on the UK government''s "green list" of places to visit.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Because they are on the amber list, travellers returning from Italy, Spain, and Greece must self-isolate for ten days. The government has issued a warning against depending on vaccine passports while travelling abroad: only a few countries presently recognise proof of vaccination. People will need to follow other restrictions when travelling abroad, such as having a negative pre-departure test.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final Words</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Europe is adopting a vaccine passport plan for its inhabitants, allowing them to travel freely around the clock. However, this would not apply to British people, who would have to rely on individual country restrictions for travel.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Fifty million vaccine doses have been administered in England, and people aged 32 and 33 are being encouraged to schedule their first vaccination this weekend. It’ll help them to buy online British Airways flights without worrying about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_testing"><strong>COVID-19 tests</strong></a>.</p>', N'what-must-you-know-about-the-uk-covid-19-vaccine-passport', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 325, 1, CAST(N'2021-06-01T06:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Pakistan is to launch COVID-19 vaccination cards on all flights, including <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/pakistan-international-airlines-flights"><strong>online PIA flights</strong></a> , Air Blue, and other airlines with international travel.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In many other countries, COVID-19 vaccinations cards have become one of the most important travel documents. Now the same is going to happen in Pakistan. The government is already struggling with the devastation that COVID-19 has brought. So, it’s very important to follow the rules and regulations to make sure that you and others are safe from the virus. That’s where the covid-19 vaccine cards will come in handy. You’ll need to carry that whether you’re going for online air ticket booking Pakistan.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Card of Covid-19</span>!</h3> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Doctor Zaeem Zia (DHO) agrees that the virus''s vaccination card should be one of the travelling documents. Not only will it make the whole checking process easy, but it will also make sure that people are safe. He said that the government is planning for that, and NCOC (National Command and Operation Center) will be launching an online portal very soon. This portal will allow people to download their vaccination cards for the virus to show to the airlines and authorities for better and seamless travel. It will help all the people consider going for <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>online air ticket booking in Pakistan</strong></a> for an easy air travel experience.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You should keep in mind that two out of four provinces of Pakistan, Sindh, and Punjab, are already issuing the vaccination cards to the people. The cards are issued once a person is vaccinated in the hospital. But it also worth mentioning that not all the people so far have been granted the cards. According to a recent report, about 29,000 people are remaining. But the authorities are taking the necessary and important steps to make sure that they get their cards as soon as possible.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Regulations for Ramadan and then Hajj</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Saudi Government is planning a vaccination card process to traveller. The most important thing about this that you need to keep in mind if you are palling to go on Umrah this Ramadan with online PIA flights or any other, then you might need to show your vaccination card. Otherwise, it’s possible that you won’t have to travel for that. If that becomes the rule, then the same will be applied for Hajj.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">One way or the other, the critics and experts suggest the COVID-19 vaccination cards will eventually become a mandatory document for all the people going on air travel. It’s just liked the polio vaccination, which is necessary for all Pakistan people.</p>

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Verdict</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">During the last NCOC meeting, it was finalized that an online portal will allow people to download their vaccination cards. It will keep them from all the hassle of going to the hospital or the health authority offices to collect them. People only will need to enter their CNIC number, and the system will check if they are vaccinated or not. After verification, all the vaccinated people will be provided with the COVID-19 vaccination cards.</p>', N'what-you-need-to-know-about-your-covid-19-vaccine-card', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 462, 1, CAST(N'2021-04-20T10:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PIA Start Flight Operation to Ras Al Khaimah</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">From 28th August 2021, Pakistan International Airlines, the country''s flagship carrier, has started offering <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>cheap flights</strong></a> from Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and Peshawar to Ras Al Khaimah, which is the northernmost emirate. It is the biggest news for many Pakistani citizens who work in the UAE but couldn’t go there because of the COVID-19. If you are one of those, you can now book PIA flights from Pakistan to the UAE. But it is important to note that you will need to follow all the safety protocols that both countries have put in place to avoid all unwanted situations.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Great News for Stranded Jobbers</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This would be a massive comfort for Pakistanis stuck in their own country and cannot return to work or join their families. Following months of passenger flight restrictions, UAE officials said earlier that travellers from Pakistan, one of the six banned nations, may return to the Emirates if certain conditions were met. Now Pakistani travellers can book PIA cheap flights to go to the UAE to resume their jobs.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">COVID-19 Requirements to Fulfil</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the UAE relaxed entrance rules for citizens stuck in Pakistan, PIA has increased its operating capacity. Pre-entry requirements include previous clearance from the FAIC (Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship), a negative PCR test with a 48-hour validity period, and a fast PCR test six hours before the flight''s departure.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PIA’s Already Operating Flights</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">PIA is already offering cheap online flights to many <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/emirates-airline-flights"><strong>emirates</strong></a> of the UAE, including Sharjah, Dubai, Abu Dhabi. These flights take off from all the major cities of Pakistan, but not all people could travel because of the low passenger capacity.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In collaboration with local laboratories, all airlines in Pakistan established facilities within airport grounds to undertake fast PCR testing by UAE directives to authorities. The officials from the PIA said that they recognize a strong potential in Ras Al Khaimah since there is now a lot of demand for air travel from Pakistan. The airline is now introducing big aircraft such as the Boeing 777 for this route to satisfy the demand. The airline has also expanded the PIA flights capacity for Sharjah from several Pakistan cities, including Sialkot, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, and Islamabad.</p>', N'pia-has-started-its-operations-to-ras-al-khaimah', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 292, 1, CAST(N'2021-08-30T11:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">Filled with multicultural cities, UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and astounding beaches, South Africa is a vast country nestled at the southern end of the African continent. From its beguiling towns and blissful coastlines to the extraordinarily fascinating interiors, the country has so many places that it might take a lifetime to explore it fully. However, it would not be sane to explore only a single country for your entire life. People who do not have endless vacations or unlimited money may have to be content with a shorter itinerary. Even if you only have 3 days, you can still discover several of South Africa’s significant highlights. Today’s article is focused on telling people how the short trip of 3 days to South Africa can still prove to be remunerative and rewarding. Let’s start our journey.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Day 1</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After arriving at Cape Town by <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/turkish-airlines-flights"><strong>Turkish Airlines Flights</strong></a>, you will have plenty of options to fulfill your exploration hunger. Cape Town is called the ‘Mother City’ because it offers everything, including beaches, excellent cuisine, mountains, and friendly people. Never forget to look out of the plane window for the Mother City landmarks as your plane circles above the airport.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After that, you can choose from a variety of accommodation places that offer simple as well as 5-star amenities. You can relax for 3-4 hours in the afternoon to revitalize your energies. Two hours before the sunset, go to Bloubergstrand Beach and enjoy watching the kite surfers. You can also capture the photos of the mountain as the sun is setting. For dinner, make your way to the nearby restaurant The Blue Peter, where you will be served with beef rump steaks, grilled burgers, lamb curry, and other delicious delicacies.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After witnessing the rock pools and the frosty waves of the beach, it’s time to return to your hotel. You can go back to your resting place through an evening taxi ride or public transport.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Day 2</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the morning, pick your camera and head towards the scenic suburbs of Cape Town. Boulders Beach is home to endangered African penguins where you can capture the refreshing shots of you standing with the penguins. At this beach, you will also have a chance to see the comical little birds up close. Your next stop should be at Hout Bay. It is a quaint fishing town famous for its picturesque cliff views. You should definitely treat yourself to a seafood lunch before leaving this place.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, drive west into the Western Cape Winelands that are full of life and greenery. There are a total of three areas – Paarl, Stellenbosch, and Franschoek, and all of them are littered with wine estates. You can pick any one of the areas and spend the day touring the land, tasting various vintages, and dining on seasonal cuisine. If you are not sure which state to choose, you can book a trip on Franschhoek Wine Tram. This tour will take you through the enthralling scenery of Franschhoek Valley while stopping along the way for tastings at different estates. You can fend off the day’s exhaustion at one of the luxury hotels here.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Day 3</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the last day of your itinerary, fly to Johannesburg through <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/"><strong>Cheap Airline Tickets</strong></a> and spend the entire day sightseeing. As soon as you land on the city’s surface, get a taxi and head to Shesha Tuk. Here, you will have the opportunity to capture your photo in front of the statue of Nelson Mandela. You can go to the nearby Mushroom Park for an orderly stroll. However, if you are feeling adventurous, then a hot-air balloon ride would be a perfect choice. Obviously, your trip to South Africa would not complete without going to Lilies leaf Farm. It is a historic site and a former camp for liberation leadership.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the afternoon, make your way into the city’s dense and happening core. Go to the Constitution Hill and observe the Old Fort Prison, where Gandhi was imprisoned. After that, visit the Rosebank Craft Market and buy some locally made treasures to bring the souvenirs back home. Plus, never forget to visit the Cradle of Humankind, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that will take you to the days of ancient civilization.  At the end of the day, try something spicy for lunch and go back to the O.R Tambo International Airport, where you will conveniently get the flight for your home country.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final Thoughts</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The beauty and the magic of South Africa will surely compel you to stay here even longer. Even if you spend 365 days of the year in South Africa, you will still be missing plenty of things. Therefore, just head to the places mentioned here and join the club of people who have successfully experienced the magnificence of this country.

This popular 6.5-hectare stretch runs from Queen Street East to the Lakeshore and is also completely wheelchair accessible. The plastic mat system starts at the bottom of the pool building and runs down to the shore, allowing mobile devices to access water and sand. If lazing around in grassy terrain sounds a bit boring to you, join the history buffs and instead explore the old gardener''s cottage on the estate.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scarborough Bluffs</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Created by the natural processes of wind and water erosion from Lake Ontario, this stunning site offers spectacular views as well as trails, beaches, and excellent butterfly watching during spring and fall migrations. The inclusion here can be considered a bit of a cheat as the whole area covers nine parks.

</ul>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alignment with Qantas Airlines</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These timings are strategically chosen because they align with the schedule of Qantas Airlines. It will help the regular travel to take Qatar Airways flight deals easily because they are used to this schedule. The only lounges available for Qatar Airways are the ones that people use for the Qantas flights. However, all the Qantas lounges will remain closed. It will allow the Qatar Airways passengers to access the gold level lounges and enjoy all the available services and amenities.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Remarks of Qatar Airways CEO</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">CEO of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker, passengers can anticipate the same level of service as before the outbreak. The only thing that Qatar Airways follows is the Covid regulations since the world is still not out of the woods yet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, wearing a mask while passengers sit in their seats and avoiding eating or roaming around the aisles is still important whether you book cheap flights or first class.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why You Don’t need Mask in Qsuites</span>!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Al Baker, masking restrictions are reduced in the high-walled private Qsuites since they already allow the passengers to be secluded. While sitting in a Qsuite, you will be completely contained, so you won’t need to wear a mask all the time. It is great news for both Australian and Qatari residents, and they now will be able to travel between these two countries by booking Qatar Airways flight tickets easily.</p>', N'qatar-airways-resumes-sydney-and-melbourne-flights', N'Muhammad Ibrahim', NULL, 214, 1, CAST(N'2021-10-27T12:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)

<h3>4.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reserve Hotel Near Beach</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you really want to see the eye catching and feel the breathtaking picturesque then you should prefer to reserve resort or hotel over the beaches. We know, due to the multiple Islands it is quite difficult to select any one. In this case, you should prefer the cheap staying location because the view and the display of the Island or the beaches are remaining same because it’s provides us by the nature and nature doesn’t believe in the discrimination. So, the main purpose of planning is to design the itinerary flexible that is easily met with all type of budgets. The names of hotels are written below.</p>

The visitors who are interested to stay in the local areas in between the citizens, then they should be careful according the norms and the tradition of its local families. In the local stay locations, tourists should wear the full covered clothes, even female wear stolen too and don’t disrespect citizen’s religious norms.

Yes, as the tropical region explorer, you should bring with you the moisturizers that protect your skin layers from the damaging and always prefer to use reef, coral and marine life safe sunscreen because it will protect your skin regarding the surrounding nature. Don’t think that you will buy it at the Maldives because these cosmetics will be expensive for you. Therefore, you should buy it at your domestic area.</p>

<h3>7.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Affordable Transportation</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Always prefer to reserve the affordable transportation from the air travel to the domestic movement too.

But severe type of protest disturbed the daily life routines. People do not move to its duty places, if they are already in offices or duty place then they stuck there because outside is not safe for them. Transport banned for one town to other town, sometimes all automobile, vehicles and railway trains close and get threads on moving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While airplanes are free from all these kinds of illegal problems because airlines provides services in the space which is free of all disturbance.  They are always ready to go on its destination on time. Flights don’t bother this type of stress. If you take any flight on time then it landed you on your location timely.</p>

</div>', N'<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a blessing of Allah SWT that Pakistan is among one of the countries having unique opportunities for tourists. Be it cultural tourism, religious tourism, or international tourism, Pakistan offers everything to cater to the needs of travel aficionados. However, after the unfortunate incident of 9/11, Pakistan had to endure a painful downfall in tourism activities. The spate of terror attacks and a brutal wave of terrorism inflicted a disastrous horror on the soft image of Pakistan, and as a result, the foreign tourists stopped visiting the fascinating places of this country.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">However, given the countless sacrifices of Pakistani security forces and Pakistani people, the menace of terrorism has finally been defeated. Now, more and more people are exploring Pakistan by <a href="https://www.faremakers.com/serene-air-flights   "><strong>Serene Air Ticket Booking</strong></a>, and it is predicted that Pakistan would become the major tourist spot in the years to come.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently, a report has been published by the Pakistan Tourism Development Cooperation (PMDC) that states that inbound tourism has witnessed a sharp increase of 70% in 2018. Here, we will dissect the whole report of PMDC and tell you about the factors that have contributed to the resurgence of the tourism industry in Pakistan. Let’s get started.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thorough Analysis Of Report</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The report highlights the initiatives taken by the incumbent government and to what extent these endeavors have affected tourism. It states that in 2017, around 10,447 people visited Pakistan on tourist visas. However, in 2018, more than 17,283 people came to Pakistan to visit tourist attractions. The dramatic surge in the number of foreign tourists is the testimony to the concerted efforts of government on the tourism sector.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">PMDC analyzes tourism growth on a yearly basis, and in this report, they have guided the readers by comparing the year 2018 with the preceding years. Here, we have put some light at the year by year statistics of tourism in Pakistan.</p>

<strong>Must Read:</strong> <a style="color:Purple;" href="https://blog.faremakers.com/Blog/2019/10/28/journey-of-pakistan-tourism   "><strong>Journey Of Pakistan Tourism</strong></a>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2013</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the year 2013, more than 10,560 foreign tourists came here on tourist visas and visited the various parts of the country by Serene Air Ticket Booking. Even though terrorism was prevalent at that time, but the overall image of Pakistan was positive, and the obsession of people with the scenic views of Pakistan had not diminished.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2014</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2014, only 5,575 people came here on tourist visas, implying that the tourism industry dealt a major blow in that year. It is because the terrorist attacks skyrocketed in 2014, and people hesitated to visit Pakistan for fear of being killed or terrorized.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015/2016</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">However, in 2015 and 2016, Pakistan observed a slight improvement in the tourism sector as the number of foreign tourists climbed to 6,475 and 9,161 respectively. Undoubtedly, the surge in the number of tourists was due to the eradication of terrorist activities in Pakistan.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2017</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2017, the number of foreign tourists reached the 2013’s level as more than 10,447 people visited the country. At that time, foreigners had finally realized that Pakistan was a safe country to travel, and they could freely go wherever they wanted.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2018</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">2018 saw an amazing increase of 70% in the inbound tourism of Pakistan. By 2018, terrorism had been completely defeated, and the country had become entirely secure for foreigners. 2018 was the only year in the history of Pakistan in which more than 17,283 foreign people landed on our soil.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Primary Reasons For The Improvement In The Tourism Sector</span>:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There are plenty of reasons why the people of foreign countries have once again started to visit Pakistan. The initiatives of the governments have restored the trust of foreign tourists, and people have now begun to perceive Pakistan as a major tourist destination. Once they land on Pakistan, they travel to different places of Pakistan through Serene Air Ticket Booking. The primary reasons for the improvement in the tourism sector are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eradication of terrorism.</li>
<li>Certain waivers and compensations for the foreigners.</li>
<li>Awareness drives of government through social media.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The tourism experts believe that if the current situations persist, the influx of foreign tourists will increase in the years ahead. It is also believed that Pakistan will be hosting more than 40,000 foreigners by the end of 2020.</p>', N'inbound-tourism-in-pakistan-increased-by-70-in-the-last-year', N'Hamza Farooq', NULL, 978, 1, CAST(N'2019-11-28T10:00:00.0000000+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), CAST(N'2024-03-19T14:16:25.3966667+00:00' AS DateTimeOffset), 1)
